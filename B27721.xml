            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Shall in a few words, give the <hi>Reader</hi> an account of the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and design of the small en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourse. Some while since I published a Treatise about the <hi>Reason of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Grounds whereon we believe the Scripture to be the Word of God</hi> with that Faith which is our Duty, and prerequired unto all other acceptable Obedience. But although this be the first funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principle of <hi>Supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> yet is it not sufficient unto
<pb facs="tcp:200371:3"/> any of the Ends thereof, (that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture to be a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) unless we understand the Mind and Will of God therein reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At least the Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of those things wherein our <hi>present Duty and future State of Blessedness or Misery</hi> are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned, are no less indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly necessary unto us, then is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Scripture to be the Word of God. To declare the way and means whereby we may <hi>assuredly</hi> attain that understanding, is the Design of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourse; as those whereby we come infallibly to believe the Scripture with Faith Divine and Supernatural, are the Subject of the former. My prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal scope in both hath been to manifest that such is the abundant <hi>Goodness, Wisdom and Grace of God,</hi> in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us the inestimable benefit of his Word, that no persons whatever, shall
<pb facs="tcp:200371:3"/> or can come short of the Advantage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, but through their own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful negligence and ingratitude, the highest crimes in things of a spiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concernment. For he hath given such convincing <hi>Evidences</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure or emanation of the Scripture from himself, by the Divine Inspiration of the Penmen thereof; and so <hi>plainly declared</hi> his Mind and Will therein, as unto the Faith and Obedience which he requires of any or all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in their various circumstances, that every one who takes <hi>care of his own present and eternal welfare,</hi> may and shall in the due use of the means by him appointed, and discharge of the duties by him prescribed unto that end, with a due Dependance on the Aid and Assistances, which he will not withhold from any who diligently seek him, infallibly attain that measure of the knowledge of his Mind and Will,
<pb facs="tcp:200371:4"/> with <hi>full assurance</hi> therein, as will be sufficient to guide him unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Blessedness. The same measure of Divine Knowledge is not required in all and every one, that they may live unto God, and come unto the enjoyment of him. The Dispensation of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mankind in Nature, Providence, and Grace, is an invincible Spring of such variety among them, as will not allow a prescription of the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Knowledge unto all to have a consistency with Divine Wisdom and Goodness; and a supposition of it would bring confusion into all the Order of things and persons which is of Divine Constitution. Nor is it pretended that any <hi>one man</hi> may or can have, in the use of any means whatever, a full comprehension of all Divine Revelations in this life, nor perhaps of any one of them; or that <hi>all men</hi> in the use of the same means prescribed unto them,
<pb facs="tcp:200371:4"/> shall have the same conceptions of all things revealed. The Scripture was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the use of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> and that in all Ages, States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with respect unto that inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variety of Circumstances, which all sorts of causes do distribute the whole multitude of them into. Wherefore the Wisdom of God therein, hath suited it self unto the Instruction of <hi>every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Believer,</hi> unto the moment of his entrance into Eternity. That any one of them, that any society of them should have a <hi>perfect comprehension</hi> of the entire Revelation of God, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect understanding of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every part of it, with all that is contained therein, was never required of them in <hi>a way of Duty,</hi> nor ever designed unto them in a way of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For besides that he hath reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it with <hi>unfathomable stores,</hi> unsearchable Treasures of Divine Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="tcp:200371:5"/> wherein we cannot <hi>find out the Almighty unto Perfection,</hi> and hath provided <hi>another state</hi> for the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of that by sight, which is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Adoration and Admiration in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; such Knowledge is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto any, that they may lead the life of Faith, and discharge the Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in all holy Obedience unto God. Yea, such a Knowledge and Comprehension would be inconsistent with that state and condition wherein we are to walk with God, according to the Tenor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof. But the substance of what we plead for is, that such is the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodness, and Love of God towards Mankind, in the <hi>Grant</hi> that he hath made unto them of the Revelation of himself, his Mind and Will in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that no one person doth, or can fail from attaining all that understanding in it and of it, which is <hi>any way need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:200371:5"/> for his Guidance to live unto God in his Circumstances and Relations, so as to come unto the blessed enjoyment of him, but by the sinful neglect of the Means and Dutys prescribed by him for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of that understanding, and want of a due dependance on those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Aids and Assistances which he hath prepared for that end. By what waies and means he hath thus provided for the assurance and security of all men, in things of their eternal concernment, and what are those Acts of his Wisdom, Power and Grace which he exerts for that end, namely, that they may both <hi>believe the Scripture to be his Word,</hi> and <hi>understand his Mind revealed therein,</hi> both according unto what is required of them in a way of duty, so as in both they may be accepted with him, is the Design of this and the other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Discourse to declare. And they are both of them principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:200371:6"/> for the use of the ordinary sort of Christians, who know it their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be established in the Truth of those things wherein they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed. For they are frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued with those Questions, <hi>How do you know the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi> And <hi>what Assurance have you that you understand any thing contained in them, seeing all sorts of persons are divided about their sense &amp; meaning, nor do you pretend unto any immediate Inspiration to give you Assurance?</hi> And if on these ensnaring enquiries, they are cast under any doubts or perplexities in their minds, as it often falls out amongst them who have not diligently weighed the Principles of their own Profession, the next Insinuation is, that they ought to betake themselves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to some other present Guide, as their own Light and Reason, or make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Resignation of themselves and the
<pb facs="tcp:200371:6"/> conduct of their Souls, unto the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> Authority and Guidance of other men. To give Assurance and Security unto their minds, that they neither are, nor can be deceived in their belief of the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and the understanding of his Mind and Will therein, so far as their present Obedience and Eternal Happiness are concerned, and that unto this end, they need not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding unto any, nor depend on any but <hi>God himself,</hi> in the use of known and obvious Means or Duties, is designed in these small Treatises. And upon the <hi>Principles</hi> evinced and confirmed in them, I have yet proposed a farther Enquiry, namely, <hi>What conduct in these times of great contests about the Assurance of Faith, &amp; the Causes of it, every one that takes care of his own Salvation, ought to betake himself unto, that he may not be deceived nor miscarry in the end?</hi> And this is designed with espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb facs="tcp:200371:7"/> Respect unto the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which vehemently pretends unto the sole infallible conduct in these things. But probably the near Approach of the daily expected, and earnestly desired <hi>hour of my Discharge</hi> from all farther service in this world, will prevent the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of that Intention. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Prospect hereof do I yet live and rejoyce, which among other Advantages unspeakable, hath already given me an Inconcernment in those Oppositions, which the Passions or Interests of men engage them in, of a very near Alliance unto, and scarce distinguishable from that which the Grave will afford. I have but one thing more to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wherewith I shall close this Preface, and it is the same with that wherewith the Preface unto the former Discourse is concluded. This also belongeth unto the second part of my Discourse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Dispensation and Operations
<pb facs="tcp:200371:7"/> of the Holy Spirit. The first Volume on that Subject, some years since publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having found good Acceptance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are Godly and Learned, both at home and abroad. I have been desired to give out what yet remaineth for the compleat Accomplishment of what I had designed thereon, in this way of lesser Discourses, that may have their use, before the whole be finished, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever it be so or no.</p>

               <p>Thus hath it faln out in the world in this matter; so hath the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deal with all Christians. Their main endeavour is to seize those <hi>Springs</hi> of Religion into their own power. The Scripture it self they tell us, cannot be believed to be the word of God with Faith Divine, but upon the proposal and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Church; thereby is one <hi>Spring</hi> secured. And when it is believed so to be, it <hi>ought</hi> not to be interpreted, it <hi>cannot</hi> be understood, but according to the mind, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and exposition of the same Church; which in like manner secures the other.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:200371:9"/> And having of old possessed these <hi>Springs</hi> of Christian Religion, they have dealt with them according as might be expected from unjust invaders of other mens Rights, and <hi>malae fidei possessoribus.</hi> So when the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi> contended for the Wells which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> had digged, when they had got possession of them, they <hi>stopped</hi> them up. And when the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> had gotten the <hi>Key of Knowledg,</hi> they would neither enter into the Kingdom of God themselves, nor suffer those that would, so to do; as our Saviour tells us. For the one of these <hi>Springs,</hi> which is the Letter of the Scripture it self, when it ought to have gone forth like the <hi>waters of the Sanctuary,</hi> to refresh the Church and make it fruitful unto God, they partly stopped it up, and partly diverted its course, by shutting it up in an <hi>unknown tongue,</hi> and debarring the people from the use of it. And in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their pretended Right unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Spring,</hi> or the <hi>sole interpretation</hi> of the Scripture, they have poysoned the streams, with all manner of Errors and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, so as that they became not only useless, but noxious and pernitious unto the Souls of men. For under the pretence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely, that their Church hath the <hi>sole</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:200371:10"/>
                  <hi>power of interpreting the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre</hi> therein, have they obtruded all their Errors with all their abominations in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Practise on the minds and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men.</p>
               <p>The first of these <hi>Springs</hi> I have in a former Discourse on this Subject taken out of their hand, so far as we our selves are concerned therein, or I have vindicated the just Rights of all Christians thereunto, and given them possession thereof. This I did by declaring the true grounds and reasons whereon we do, and whereon any can truly <hi>believe the Scripture to be the word of God,</hi> with Faith divine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. For besides other advantages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the knowledge of that Truth is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied; it dispossesseth the <hi>Romanists</hi> of their claim unto this Fountain of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by evidencing that we do, and ought thus to believe the Divine Original of the Scripture, without any regard to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony or Authority of their Church.</p>
               <p>That which now lyeth before us is the Vindication of the Right of all Believers unto the <hi>other Spring also,</hi> or a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the mind and will of God, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scripture, suitably unto the duty that God requireth of them in their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200371:10"/> several capacities and conditions.</p>
               <p>What is necessary unto the <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of difficult places</hi> and passages in the Scripture, what measure of understanding of the mind and will of God as revealed therein, is required of persons in their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conditions, as they are <hi>Teachers</hi> of others, or among the number of them that are to be taught; shall among other things be afterwards spoken unto. My principal Design is to manifest, That <hi>every Believer may in the due use of the means appointed of God for that End, attain unto such a full assurance of understanding in the Truth, or all that knowledge of the mind and will of God revealed in the Scripture, which is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct him in the life of God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from the dangers of Ignorance, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Error, and to conduct him unto Blessedness.</hi> Wherefore, as unto the Belief of the Scripture it self, so as unto the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Knowledge and Faith of the things contained therein, we do not depend on the <hi>Authoritative Interpretation</hi> of any Church or person whatever. And although ordinary Believers are obliged to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and conscientious use of the <hi>Ministry of the Church</hi> among other things, as a means appointed of God to lead, guide, and instruct
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200371:11"/> them in the knowledge of his Mind and Will revealed in the Scripture, which is the principal End of that Ordinance; yet is not their understanding of the Truth, their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it, and Faith in it, to rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to be resolved into their Authority, who are not appointed of God to be <hi>Lords of their Faith,</hi> but <hi>helpers of their joy.</hi> And hereon depends all our interest in that great Promise, That we <hi>shall be all taught of God.</hi> For we are not so, unless we do learn from him, and by him, the things which he hath revealed in his Word.</p>
               <p>And there is not any Truth of greater importance for Men to be Established in. For unless they have a <hi>full assurance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in themselves,</hi> unless they hold their perswasion of the sense of Scripture Revelations from God alone, if their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgment of Truth and Falsehood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Authority of Men, they will never be able to undergo any suffering for the Truth, or to perform any Duty unto God in a right manner. The Truths of the Gospel, and the ways of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, for which any Believer may be called to suffer in this world, are such as about <hi>whose Sense</hi> and <hi>Revelation in the Scripture,</hi> there is great difference and controversie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200371:11"/> among Men. And if there be not an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea infallible way and means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating unto all Believers, a knowledg of the Mind and Will of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning those things so controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the grounds whereof are fixed in their own minds, but that they do wholly depend on the Expositions and <hi>Interpretations</hi> of other Men, be they who they will, they cannot <hi>suffer</hi> for them either cheerfully or honourably, so as to give glory to God, or to obtain any solid peace and comfort in their own Souls. For if a man under his <hi>Sufferings</hi> for his Profession, can give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no other account but this, That what he suffers for, is the Truth of God revealed in the Scripture, because such or such whom he hath in veneration or Esteem do so affirm, and have so instructed him; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the Doctrine of this or that Church, the <hi>Papal</hi> or the <hi>reformed Church,</hi> which it hath prescribed unto him; he will have little joy of his Suffering in the End. Yea, there is that which is yet worse in this matter as things are stated at this day in the World. Truth and Error are promiscuously <hi>persecuted</hi> according unto the Judgment, Interest, and Inclinations of them that are in power. Yea, sometimes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:200371:12"/> both Truth and Error are <hi>persecuted</hi> in the same place, and at the same time, upon Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors differing from both. Dissent is grown almost all that is criminal in Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion all the World over. But in this State of things, unless we grant Men an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>understanding of their own</hi> in the Mind and Will of God, yea, a <hi>full assurance</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, there will be nothing whereby a Man who suffers for the most important Truths of the Gospel, can in his own soul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science distinguish himself from those who suffer in giving Testimony unto the most pernitious Errors; For all outward means of confidence which he hath, they may have also.</p>
               <p>It behoveth therefore all those who may possibly be called <hi>to suffer for the Truth</hi> in any season or on any occasion, to assure their minds in this Fundamental Truth; that they may have in themselves a certain undeceiving understanding of the Mind and Will of God, as revealed in the Scripture, independent on the Authority of any Church or Persons whatsoever; the use of whose Ministry herein we do yet freely and fully allow.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed without a supposition hereof can any man perform any Duty to God in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:200371:12"/> an acceptable manner, so as that his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> nor can upon good grounds dye in peace, since the <hi>Just shall live by his own Faith alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore our present Enquiry is;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How Believers or any men whatever, may attain a right understanding in their own Minds of the meaning and sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as to the Doctrine or Truths contained in them, in answer unto the Design of God, as unto what he would have us know or believe,</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How they may attain a right perception of the Mind of God in the Scripture, and what he intends in the Revelation of it, in opposition unto Ignorance, Errors, Mistakes, and all false apprehensions, and so in a right manner to perform the Duties which by them we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer unto the enquiry proposed concerning the knowledge and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Believers in the Mind of God, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures; I shall consider First, the <hi>Principal Efficient Cause.</hi> And Secondly, <hi>All the means,</hi> Internal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal which are appointed of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>As to the first of these, or the Principal Efficient Cause of the due knowledge and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200371:13"/> understanding of the Will of God in the Scripture, it is the <hi>Holy Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is an especial work of the Spirit of God on the Minds of Men, communicating Spiritual Wisdom, Light, and Ʋnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto them, necessary unto their discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and apprehending aright the Mind of God in his Word, and the understanding of the Mysteries of Heavenly Truth contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> And I shall add hereunto; That among all the false and foolish imaginations that ever Christian Religion was attacqued or disturbed withal, there never was any, there is none more pernitious than this, That the Mysteries of the Gospel are so exposed unto the common Reason and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Men, as that they may know them and comprehend them in an <hi>usefull manner,</hi> and <hi>according to their Duty,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effectual Aid and Assistance of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>It is the fondest thing in the World to imagine, That the Holy Ghost doth any way teach us, but <hi>in and by our own Reasons</hi> and Understandings. We renounce all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasmes</hi> in this matter, and plead not for any immediate <hi>Prophetical Inspirations.</hi> Those who would prohibit us the use of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200371:13"/> our Reason in the things of Religion, would deal with us, as the <hi>Philistines</hi> did with <hi>Sampson,</hi> first put out our Eyes, and then make us grind in their Mill. Whatever we know, be it of what sort it will, we know it in, and by the use of our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and what we conceive, we do it by our own understanding. Only the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is, whether there be not an especial Work of the Holy Spirit of God, <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Minds,</hi> and enabling our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings to perceive and apprehend his Mind and Will as revealed in the Scripture, and without which, we cannot so do. The substance therefore of the Ensuing Discourse may be reduced unto these Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we stand not in need of any new divine <hi>Afflations,</hi> or immediate <hi>Prophetical inspirations</hi> to enable us to understand the Scripture, or the Mind and Will of God, as revealed therein. Neither did the Prophets or Holy Penmen of the Scripture <hi>learn the Mind of God</hi> in the Revelations made unto them, and by them unto the Church, meerly from the <hi>Divine Inspiration</hi> of them. Those immediate Inspirations unto them, were in the stead and place of the <hi>written Word,</hi> and no otherwise. After they did receive them, they were by the same means to inquire
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200371:14"/> into the Mind and Will of God in them; as we do it, in and by the Written Word. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That as to the right understanding of the Mind of God in the Scripture, or our coming unto the <hi>Riches of the full assurance of understanding in the acknowledgment of the Mystery of God;</hi> we do not, nor need to depend on the <hi>Authoritative Instruction</hi> or Interpretation of the Scripture by <hi>any Church</hi> whatever, or all of them in the World, though there be great use of the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Church unto that End.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in the <hi>meer exercise of our own natural Reason and Ʋnderstanding,</hi> with the help of External means, we cannot attain that knowledge of the Mind and Will of God in the Scripture, of the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost therein, which is required of us in a way of Duty, without the special aid and assistance of the Holy Spirit of God. Wherefore principally it is asserted,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is an especial work of the Holy Spirit in the <hi>supernatural Illumination</hi> our Minds, needful unto the End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; namely, That we may aright and according unto our Duty, understand the Mind of God in the Scripture our selves, or Interpret it unto others.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:200371:14"/> 5. That hereby alone is that full <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of understanding in the knowledge of the Mystery of God,</hi> his Truth and Grace to be obtained, whereby any man may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Mind and Will of God, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his own duty in all that he may be called to do or suffer in this World, in his especial Circumstances. Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="6">6. The certainty and assurance that we may have, and ought to have of our right understanding the Mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; either in general, or as to any especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Doctrine, doth not depend upon, is not resolved into any <hi>immediate Inspiration or Enthusiasme;</hi> it doth not depend upon, nor, is resolved into the <hi>Authority of any Church</hi> in the World; nor is it the <hi>Result of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Ʋnderstanding</hi> meerly in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actings, but as they are Elevated, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, Guided, Conducted by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal efficacious work of the Spirit of God upon them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That whereas the means of the right Interpretation of the Scripture and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Mind of God therein, are of two sorts; First, such as are prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto us in a way of Duty, as <hi>Prayer, Meditation</hi> on the Word it self, and the like; and Secondly, <hi>Disciplinary,</hi> in the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:200371:15"/> of <hi>Arts and Sciences</hi> with all kind of Learning unto that Work; the first sort of them doth intirely depend on a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Spiritual Aids mentioned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, they are of no use; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not only consistent therewith, but singularly subservient thereunto; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the nature and use of all these means, shall be afterwards declared.</p>
               <p>This being the substance of what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in the ensuing Discourse, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Positions before laid down concerning the <hi>especial Work</hi> of the Spirit on the Minds of Men, in communicating Spiritual Wisdom, Light, and Knowledge unto them, is in the first place, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be confirmed, as that whereon all the other Assertions do absolutely depend.</p>
               <p>It is the Scripture it self alone from whence the Truth in this matter can be learned; and by which alone what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed concerning it must be tried; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as unto this first part of this Work I shall do little more than plead the express Testimonies thereof. When we come to consider the way and manner of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of these spiritual Aids unto us, the whole matter will be more fully sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and such Objections as may be laid
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200371:15"/> against our Assertion be removed out of the way.</p>
               <p>And there are two Ends designed in this undertaking. 1. That which the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list Luke</hi> proposed in this writing the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto <hi>Theophilus;</hi> namely, <hi>That he might know the certainty of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had been instructed,</hi> Luke 1. 4. When we have been instructed in the Truth of the Gospel, and do give our Assent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, yet it is needful that we should exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the grounds and reasons of what we do believe thereon, that we may have a <hi>certainty</hi> or <hi>full assurance</hi> of them. This therefore we shall direct; namely, How a man may come to an <hi>undeceiving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and full Assurance</hi> that the things wherein he hath been instructed, and which he knows, are true and according to the Mind of God, so as that he may thereon be <hi>no more tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> by the slight of Men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We design to enquire what <hi>conduct</hi> unto this End a Man that takes care of his Salvation, and who is convinced that he must give an account of himself unto God, ought in this matter, as to the right
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:200371:16"/> understanding of the Mind and Will of God in the Scripture <hi>to betake himself unto.</hi> And as I shall shew that there is no safety in depending on <hi>Enthusiasmes,</hi> or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate pretended infallible Inspirations; nor on the <hi>pretended Infallibility</hi> of any Church: <hi>So the holy Spirit of God enlightning our Minds in the Exercise of our own Reason or Ʋnderstanding, and in use of the means appointed of God unto that End, is the only safe Guid to bring us unto the full Assurance of the Mind and Will of God, as Revealed in the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the whole Foundation of this Work lies in these two things. (1.) That there is such an <hi>especial Work</hi> of the Holy Spirit on our Minds, enabling them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures in a right manner, or to know the Mind of God in them. (2.) In shewing what is the <hi>especial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of this Work, what are the effects of it upon our Minds, and how it differs from all <hi>Enthusiastical Inspirations,</hi> and what is the true Exercise of our Minds in compliance therewith; And these things we shall first enquire into.</p>

What we pray for from God, that we have not in, and of ourselves; as the Antient Church constantly pleaded against the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> And what we pray for according to the Mind of God, that we do receive.

                  </gap>—are things that have such an Impression of Divine Wisdom and Power upon them, as that they are justly the Object of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. That which is too hard for us; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:200371:18"/> of the Law, are those Expressions and Effects of Divine Wisdom in the Scripture, which are above the Natural Reason and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of Men to find out and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Such are the Mysteries of Divine Truth in the Scripture; especially, because Christ is in them, whose Name is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Wonderful; Isa.</hi> 9. 6. For all the great and marvellous Effects of infinite Wisdom meet in him. These things and Doctrines God calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 12. I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto him the <hi>great things of my Law;</hi> and they were counted by them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—as a <hi>strange thing.</hi> Because they were <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi> in themselves, they neglected and dispised them, as that which was Forraign and <hi>alien</hi> from them, which belonged not unto them. So deal many with the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Gospel at this day; because they are heavenly, Spiritual, in themselves marvellous, hidden, and above the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Natural Reason of Men; that is, They are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—they reject and dispise them as things <hi>alien</hi> and forreign unto their Religion. Wherefore, the <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things</hi> of the Scripture, are those My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Divine Truth, Wisdom, and Grace, that are revealed and contained therein, with their especial Respect unto Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:200371:18"/> 3. Three things are supposed in the words concerning these wonderful things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are <hi>recorded,</hi> laid up or treasured in the Law or Scripture, and no where else; so as that from thence alone, are they to be learned and received. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold wonderful things out of the Law.</hi> That alone is the sacred <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory of them. There are wondrous things in the works of Nature and Providence; and much of them is contained in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of Reason, wherein it may be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But these are stored in the <hi>Law</hi> only, and no where else.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is our Duty to <hi>behold,</hi> to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern,</hi> to <hi>understand</hi> them, to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection into them, and our great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge when we are enabled so to do. This makes the Psalmist pray so frequently, so fervently, that he may have the discerning of them, or come to an acquaintance with them. Those therefore by whom they are neglected, do both dispise their Duty, and forsake their own Mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we are not <hi>able of our selves</hi> thus to discern them without Divine Aid and Assistance. For the Psalmist who was wiser than the wisest of us, and who had so earnest a desire after these things, yet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200371:19"/> would not trust unto his own Reason, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Ability, and Diligence for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them, but betakes himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by Prayer, acknowledging therein that it is <hi>the especial work of God by his Spirit, to enable us to understand his Mind and Will as revealed in the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is expressed in the words the <hi>Act of God</hi> towards us, whereby he ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us to behold, discern, and understand the wonderful effects of Divine Wisdom, which are treasured up in the Scripture, which the Psalmist prayeth for. This is called his <hi>opening of our Eyes,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal mine Eyes,</hi> uncover, unvail my eyes. There is a Light in the Word; all Truth is Light; and sacred Truth is sacred Light. Yea, the Word of God is expresly called <hi>Light, Psal.</hi> 36. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 43. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. But there is by Nature a <hi>Covering,</hi> a <hi>Veil</hi> on the Eyes of the understandings of all Men, that they are not able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to behold this <hi>Light,</hi> nor to discern anything by it in a due manner. With respect hereunto, the Psalmist prays that God would <hi>reveal his eyes. Revelare</hi> is <hi>Vela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum levare;</hi> to reveal is to take off the Veil or Covering. And this Veil is that of our Natural Darkness, Blindness, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:200371:19"/> whereof we have treated else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>I see not what is wanting unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation or confirmation of the Position before laid down. The Communication of Spiritual Light from God, is the peculiar work of the Holy Ghost. He is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Author of all Spiritual Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But hereby alone, or by vertue hereof can we know or understand the Mind of God in the Scripture, in such a manner as God requireth us to do; And whosoever hath received the Grace of this Divine <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,</hi> may do so, so far as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in point of Faith or Obedience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the written Word of God. Therein are <hi>Wonderful things</hi> or Mysteries of Divine Wisdom contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and revealed. To <hi>behold these things,</hi> is to discern and understand them aright, with respect unto our own Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This we cannot do without a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Act</hi> of the Spirit of God upon our Minds, enabling them to discern them, and understand them; These things are in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And we hence further argue, That, which is our Duty to pray for <hi>Spiritual Supernatural Aid,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to do, that of <hi>our selves</hi> we are not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:200371:20"/> able to do, without that Aid and Assistance; at least we may do it by vertue of that Aid and Assistance; which includes the Substance by just consequences of what is pleaded for. But such <hi>Aid,</hi> it is our duty to pray for, that we may understand aright the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the Mind and Will of God in the Scriptures, the only thing to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing which I can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, that may with any Pretence of Reason be objected unto this Testimony of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in particular. And this is that he speaks of the Times and Writings of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Now it is confessed that there was in them a <hi>Darkness</hi> and Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and such as needed <hi>new Revelations</hi> for the understanding of them. But since all things are <hi>brought to Light by the Gospel,</hi> there is no need of any special Aid or Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Holy Spirit by <hi>Supernatural Illumination</hi> for the understanding of them. In answer hereunto I shall consider the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Apostle, wherein he stateth this whole matter; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>And not as</hi> Moses <hi>who put a vail over his face that the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished. But their Minds were blinded:</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:200371:20"/>
                  <hi>For until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away, in the reading of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is done away in Christ. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, when it shall turn unto the Lord,</hi> (or they be turned unto the Lord) <hi>the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face behold as in a Glass the glory of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> had received the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Law from God, <hi>his face shone,</hi> Exod. 34. 29. For there were Wonderful things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Revelation with respect unto Jesus Christ; He was in them all, and the End of them all. The whole Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi> was but a Testimony given unto the things that were <hi>afterwards to be spoken</hi> concerning him, as the Apostle declares; <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>On the receipt of this Revelation <hi>his face shone;</hi> because there was a Light, a Lustre, a Glory in the things revealed unto him; and by them reflected on his Ministry, which was so represented. Nevertheless, this <hi>Light</hi> did not shine immediately into the Hearts and Minds of the People. They did not see or discern the Glorious and <hi>Wonderful</hi> things that were in the Law. For there was a <hi>double veil</hi> or covering that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:200371:21"/> them. One that was put on <hi>Moses Face;</hi> another that was on their own <hi>Hearts.</hi> Some dark apprehensions and glances of Light they had; but they could not <hi>look stedfastly</hi> unto the end of that which was to be abolished; they could not comprehend the Truth concerning Christ, which was the substance and end of the Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Veil,</hi> that which was on the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> was the obscurity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions given them as wrapt up in <hi>Types, Shadows,</hi> and <hi>dark Parables.</hi> This they could not see through as clearly to discern the <hi>wonderful things</hi> contained in and under them. This <hi>Veil</hi> is quite taken off, in the Revelation, or <hi>Doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> where in Life and Immortality are brought to light, and the wonderful things of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of God in Christ are fully declared, and plainly expressed. Herein therefore it is acknowledged, that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between those under the <hi>Old</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and those under the <hi>New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, saith the Apostle, there is <hi>another Veil;</hi> a <hi>Veil upon the Heart.</hi> And hereof he declareth two things; 1. That this Veil is <hi>done away only in Christ;</hi> and (2.) That therefore it is not taken away from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:200371:21"/> but those who are <hi>converted unto God.</hi> This is the <hi>Covering</hi> of Ignorance, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Blindness, that is on Men by Nature. The <hi>former Veil</hi> is taken away by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel.</hi> This latter is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved only by an <hi>effectual work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ,</hi> in the conversion of the Souls of Men unto God.</p>
               <p>And two things do ensue on the removal of this <hi>double Veil.</hi> 1. That as unto the Doctrine it self concerning the Mystery of God in Christ; it is no more represented unto us in <hi>Types, Shadows,</hi> and <hi>dark Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> but in the clear <hi>Glass of the Gospel,</hi> whereon the glory of Christ is reflected. Hereby the <hi>Veil</hi> is taken off from the <hi>Face of Moses.</hi> 2. That we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>open uncovered Face:</hi> or, as the <hi>Syriack</hi> reads it, a <hi>revealed Eye,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are enabled to discern the wonderful Mysteries of God so revealed. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues on the taking away of the <hi>second Veil</hi> of Darkness and Blindness, which is on the Hearts of all by Nature.</p>
               <p>The removal and destruction of this <hi>double Veil</hi> by the Spirit and Grace of the Gospel, is that which is Prophecied of <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 7. <hi>And he shall destroy in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Face,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>covering, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:200371:22"/> or the <hi>double Veil, that is on the Face of all People;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Veil Veiled over all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being the design of the Discourse of the Apostle; it is evident that although there be a difference between them under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> and us, as to the <hi>Veil</hi> that was on the <hi>Face of Moses,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and removed by the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospel;</hi> yet there is none, as to the <hi>Veil</hi> which is one the <hi>Hearts</hi> of all by Nature, which must be removed by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or we cannot with <hi>open Face</hi> behold the Glory of the Lord; the thing which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> prayeth for in the place insisted on. That is, that God by his Spirit would more and more renew his mind, and take away his Natural darkness and ignorance, that he might be able to behold, perceive and understand the mind of God as revealed in the Scripture: And if any shall suppose or say, that for their parts they need no such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> to enable them to understand the mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is sufficiently exposed to the common Reason of all Mankind; I shall only say at present; I am afraid they do not understand those places of Scripture, where this <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> is so expresly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be necessary thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:200371:22"/>
               <p> But the meaning of the Psalmist will the better appear, if we consider the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Grace which he prayed for unto others. This is expressed, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45. <hi>Then opened he their understandings, that they might understand the Scriptures.</hi> A needless work if some Men may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But our Lord Jesus Christ thought not so. The Truths concerning him were revealed in the Scripture, that is of the <hi>Law and the Prophets, and the</hi> Psalms, v. 44. These they read, these they were instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, these were Preached unto them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. And probably they were as well skilled in the <hi>literal Sense</hi> of Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, as those who pretend highest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, so to be. Howbeit they could not understand those wonderful things in a way of duty, and as they ought to do, until the Lord Christ <hi>opened their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</hi> There was needfull unto them an immediate gracious act of his divine power on their minds to enable them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And I cannot yet much value those mens understanding of the Scripture, whose <hi>understandings are not opened</hi> by the Spirit of Christ.</p>
               <p>If we need the <hi>openings of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> by an act of the Power and Grace
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:200371:23"/> of Christ, that we may <hi>understand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> then without it we cannot so do, namely, so as to beleive and yeild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according unto our duty; the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is evident; for if we could, there is no need of this Act of Christ towards these Disciples, who were not destitute of any <hi>rational Abilities,</hi> required in us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And the Act of Christ in <hi>opening their understandings,</hi> is openly distinguished from the proposition of the Doctrine of the Scripture unto them. This was made two ways: First, In the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In the Oral Discourse of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon it. Distinct from both these is that Act of his whereby he <hi>opened their understandings,</hi> that they might understand the Scripture. Wherefore nothing but a <hi>real Internal Act of Grace</hi> in the Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their minds can be intended thereby, the Nature whereof shall be further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained afterwards.</p>
               <p>But there is an eminent place that must be pleaded distinctly to this purpose. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory may give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him: The eyes of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings being enlightned, that you may</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:200371:23"/>
                  <hi>know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the Glory of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Saints, and what is the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatness of his power to usward who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the whole of what we would Assert, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>And if Men would acquiess by Faith in what is here declared, we need to plead this Cause no farther. For the <hi>words and expressions</hi> of the Truth here used are more <hi>Emphatical</hi> unto a Spiritual understanding, than any we can find out. And I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew in the opening of them, how our Position and Sense is contained in them. [And 1. What the Apostle doth here for others, it is unquestionably our duty to do for our selves. We are then to Pray, that God <hi>would enable us by his Spirit to know and understand his Mind and Will, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scripture.</hi> This therefore without especial Aid and Assistance from him by his Spirit, we cannot do. And the <hi>Aid</hi> he gives us consists in the <hi>effectual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> of our Minds, or the enlightning of the Eyes of our Understandings. These things are plain and not liable as I suppose to any exception. And these are all we Plead for. Let them be granted without
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:200371:24"/> any other distinctions or limitations, but what the Scripture will justifie, and there is an end of this difference. But some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular passages in the words may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered for the better understanding, and farther confirmation of the Truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>Revelation</hi> that the Apostle prays for; or <hi>a Spirit of Revelation</hi> to be given unto them. This greatly offends some at first hearing, but wholly without cause. For he understands not new <hi>immediate external Revelation from God.</hi> Believers are not directed to look after such Revelations for their Guide: Ever since the Scripture was written, the generality of the Church was obliged to attend thereunto alone, as their only Rule of Faith and Obedience. And although God reserved unto himself a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty under the Old Testament, and until the compleating of all the Books of the New, to add <hi>new Revelations</hi> as he pleased; yet he alwaies bound up the Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>present Church,</hi> unto what he had already revealed. And he hath now by the Spirit of his Son, put an end unto all expectation of any <hi>new,</hi> of any <hi>other</hi> Revelations, wherein the Faith or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Church should be concerned.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:200371:24"/> least we take it for granted in this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that <hi>infallible Inspirations</hi> in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of things not before revealed, are ceased in the Church. Nor do the <hi>Papists</hi> extend their <hi>Infallibility</hi> thereunto, but only unto things already Revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Tradition. What some among our selves do ascribe of this nature unto their <hi>Light</hi> I do not well know, nor shall now enquire.</p>
               <p>But there is an <hi>internal subjective Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereby no <hi>new things</hi> are Revealed unto our Minds, or are not outwardly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <hi>anew,</hi> but our Minds are enabled to discern the things that are Revealed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. All the things here mentioned by the Apostle, which he desires they might <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</hi> were already Revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament and the New that were then Written, and the Infallible declaration of the Gospel in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apostles. But there was a new Work of Revelation required, in, and unto every person, that would understand and comprehend these things in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> is the <hi>Discovery</hi> of any thing, whether by the <hi>proposal</hi> of it unto us, or the <hi>enabling</hi> of us to discern it when it is so proposed. In
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:200371:25"/> the first sense it is used, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. Chap. 2. 2. In the latter, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 11. As when God opened the Eyes of the Servant of <hi>Elisha</hi> on the Prayer of his Master, to see the <hi>Horses and Chariots of Fire</hi> that were round about him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 6, 17. They were not brought thither by the opening of his Eyes; only he was enabled to discern them which before he could not do. Or as when any one maketh use of a <hi>Telescope</hi> to behold things afar off, no object is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto him, but what was really in the same place before, only his <hi>visive faculty,</hi> is assisted to discern them at that distance, which without that assistance it could not reach unto. And the Holy Spirit is here called the Spirit of Revelation, <hi>causally;</hi> as he is the Author or principal efficient cause of it: So in his Communication un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Christ himself, he is called the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Ʋnderstanding; the Spirit of Counsel and Might; the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord; that should make him of quick understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fear of the Lord,</hi> Isa. 11. 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in the place before insisted on calleth in general <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi> things, the Apostle expresseth in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:200371:25"/> particular, and distributes them under sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry heads as they were more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Gospel. Such are, <hi>the hope of Gods calling, the riches of his Glory,</hi> and the <hi>exceeding greatness of his Power</hi> in them that do believe. These are some of the principal and most important my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Gospel. No other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can we have of these things, but only as they are <hi>revealed</hi> therein, or of the Revelation of them. And in the manner of his expression he declares these things to be <hi>wonderful,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks. For there is in them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the riches of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> which is beyond our comprehension. So he expresly affirms, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>past all investigation</hi> or search; the same word that he useth to set forth the ways of God, when his design is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them <hi>wonderful,</hi> or the object of our admiration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>O the depth of the Riches of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his ways, and his Judgements past finding out,</hi> And there is in them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an <hi>exceeding</hi> or inexpressible <hi>greatness of Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such are the things that are proposed unto us in the Scripture. And the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reason why some Men judge it so easie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:200371:26"/> a matter to understand and comprehend by <hi>the innate Abilities</hi> of their own minds the Revelations that are made in the word of God unto us; is, because they do not apprehend that there is any thing <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> or truly great and glorious in them. And therefore because they cannot raise their minds unto a comprehension of these Mysteries as they are in themselves; they corrupt and debase them, to suit them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own low carnal apprehensions, which is the principle that works effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the whole of <hi>Socinianism.</hi> For grant that there are such <hi>wonderful things,</hi> such Mysteries in the Gospel as we plead, and the Men of that perswasion will not deny, but that our minds do stand in need of an Heavenly Assistance to comprehend them aright. For they deny them for no other reason, but because their reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning these things so revealed in the word; the Apostle prays for these <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that they might <hi>know them;</hi> as also he expresseth the way whereby alone they might be enabled so to do. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that they might have a sight, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or understanding of them. This he denies a <hi>Natural Man</hi> to have, or that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:200371:26"/> can have; <hi>He cannot know them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. It is true, it may be said, he cannot know them unless they are <hi>clearly</hi> and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proposed unto him; no, nor then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Light and Power of his own natural Faculties. He cannot do so by the use of any outward means alone. It is futilous to imagine that the Apostle intends only, That a <hi>Natural man</hi> cannot know things that are never proposed unto him, which is neither weakness, nor discommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. For neither can the <hi>Spiritual man</hi> so know any thing.</p>
               <p>Because it is thus with men by Nature, therefore doth the Apostle so earnestly pray, That these <hi>Ephesians</hi> might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to <hi>understand</hi> and <hi>know these</hi> things, and he doth it with an unusual solemnity, invocating the <hi>God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory:</hi> which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues both a great intention of Spirit in him, and great weight laid upon the Matter of his request.</p>
               <p>But what Reason is there for this Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? What is wanting unto these <hi>Ephesians?</hi> what would he yet have for them? were they not <hi>rational men</hi> that had their Eyes in their Heads as well as others? nay, were not many of them learned Men and skilled in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:200371:27"/> all the Curious Arts of those days? for here it was, that so many upon their first Conversion burnt their Books to the value <hi>of fifty thousand pieces of Silver;</hi> Act. 19. 19. Probably they were many of them very knowing in the <hi>New and Old Philosophy.</hi> Had they not the Scripture also; that is, all the Books of the Old Testament, and those of the New which were then Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Did not the Apostle and others Preach the Doctrine of the Gospel unto them, and therein the things which he here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? He declareth, and expresly testifieth that he did, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20, 27. Speaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these very persons, that is, the Leaders of them; he saith, <hi>I have kept back nothing which was profitable unto you, but declared unto you all the counsel of God;</hi> namely, what is the hope of his Calling, and what the riches of his Glory, and what the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Power: were not these things sufficiently revealed, and clearly proposed unto them? if they were not, it was because the Apostle <hi>could not</hi> so reveal and propose them, or because he <hi>would not.</hi> If he <hi>could not,</hi> then he prays, That that might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto them which was not so to him; or that they might learn what he <hi>could not teach them,</hi> which is foolish and impious to imagine. If he <hi>would</hi> not, then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:200371:27"/> he prays, That they may know, that which he would not teach them, which he could easily have so done; which is equally foolish to suppose. What therefore do they yet lack? What is yet further needful, that they might know and understand these things? For we must know, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand no more of the Mind of God in the Revelations that he makes unto us, than we understand of the <hi>things themselves</hi> that are revealed by him.</p>
               <p>I am perswaded, That these <hi>Ephesians</hi> were generally as <hi>wise,</hi> and some of them as <hi>learned</hi> as any in our days, let them have what conceit of themselves they please. Yet grant some of ours but thus much, that they have their Wits about them, and the use of their Reason; and let them have the things of the Gospel, or the Doctrines of it rationally proposed unto them, as they are in the Scripture, and they defie the World to think that they yet want any thing to enable them to <hi>know,</hi> and rightly to understand them. To fancy any thing else to be necessary hereunto is <hi>fanatical</hi> madness. For what would Men have? what should ayle them? Are not the Doctrines of the Gospel highly <hi>rational?</hi> are not the things of it eminently suited unto the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:200371:28"/>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> of Mankind? are not the Books of the Scripture written in a Style and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>intelligible?</hi> Is there any thing more required unto the understanding of the Mind of any Author, but to conceive the <hi>Grammatical</hi> sense of the Words that he useth, and the nature of his Propositions and Arguings? And although St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as some say, <hi>be one of the obscurest Writers they ever met with;</hi> yet surely by these means some good shift may be made with his Writings also. It is therefore <hi>Canting and non-sense,</hi> a Reproach to Reason and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion it self, to think that this is not enough to enable men to understand the Mind of God in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Well be it so at present unto the highly <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Abilities</hi> of some persons; it cannot be denied, but that the Apostle judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that these <hi>Ephesians</hi> should have the <hi>special Aid of the Spirit of God</hi> unto this End, which he prayeth for. And we may be excused if we dare not think our selves better than they; nor to have a sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Learning, Wisdom, and Reason above others, or less to need Prayers of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then they did. And we find that the Apostle reneweth his Prayer for them again unto the same purpose, with great ferveny,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:200371:28"/>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. All the difference ariseth from hence, that the Apostle judgeth, that over and above the utmost exercise of our natural Faculties and Abilities in the use of outward means that we may know the Mind of God in the Scripture, wherein these <hi>Ephesians</hi> were not wanting; it is necessary that the <hi>Eyes of our Ʋnderstanding</hi> should be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually opened and enlightned; but other men it seems think not so.</p>
               <p>But yet if men should be allowed to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that our Minds were no way vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, depraved, or darkned by the Fall, which supposition is the sole foundation of these Assertions; yet it is most irrational to imagine, that we can comprehend and understand <hi>the Mysteries of the Gospel</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out especial <hi>Spiritual Illumination.</hi> For the Original Light and Abilities of our Minds was not suited or prepared for the receiving and understanding of them. For neither their Being nor Revelation was consistent with the State of Integrity. Wherefore although our Minds should be allowed to be as wise and perspicacious with respect unto that natural Knowledge of God and all that belongs unto it, which was proposed unto us, or necessary for us
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:200371:29"/> in the State of Nature; yet would it not follow, that we are able to discern the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Grace</hi> when proposed unto us. The Truth is, if our Minds be not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or depraved, there is no need of the Gospel nor its Grace; and if they are, we cannot understand the Mind of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without especial Illumination.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, That these things are consistent. For notwithstanding mens <hi>rational Abilities,</hi> and the use of means; yet it is meet that they should both <hi>pray</hi> for themselves, and that others whose du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is, should pray for them also. It is so, That they may be <hi>diligent</hi> in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and obtain the <hi>blessing of God upon their diligence.</hi> But this doth not prove at all, that they are <hi>not able of themselves</hi> to apprehend and know the Mind and Things of God in the Scripture, or that any thing is wanting in them, or to them, which is absolutely necessary thereunto.</p>
               <p>I answer, That on these suppositions; there is indeed nothing wanting, but that which the Apostle moreover prayeth for, which is none of them. And if that be not also requisite unto this end, his Prayer is vain and useless. That Men be diligent in the discharge of their duty herein, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200371:29"/> that they may have the especial blessing of God thereon, are here supposed, and we shall speak unto them afterwards. These are not the things that the Apostle here prayeth for; but that God would give them the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation to enlighten the eyes of their Ʋnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> that they may know them as shall be immediately declared. And indeed I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not how this Prayer can be suited unto the principles of any who deny the necessity of this Internal Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aid.</p>
               <p>For they cannot but think it strange to pray for a <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</hi> to be given unto their <hi>whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which were a dangerous way to make them wiser than their Teachers. And for themselves, using diligence, and praying for a blessing in their diligence, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow any farther concernment in this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The thing in especial prayed for in order unto the end proposed, is, that the <hi>Eyes of our understandings may be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> This is the same which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> prayeth for in the place before insisted on, that God <hi>would open his eyes.</hi> And it is the <hi>Internal work of Illumination</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:200371:30"/> Now although the main force of the Argument depends on these words, yet shall I not insist here upon them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I must speak somewhat more in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular unto the nature of this work after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Besides what is that <hi>Darkness</hi> which is here supposed to be on our minds or understandings, what is its Nature, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and power, how it is taken away and removed; what is the Nature of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light which is communicated unto us, in and for the removal thereof, I have at large elsewhere declared. All that at present I shall observe from these words, is in general; that there is an <hi>especial work of the Spirit of God in the enlightning the Eyes of our understandings,</hi> necessary unto our discerning of the Mysteries of the Gospel in a due manner; which was to be proved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is declared concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this work in us, or the principal efficient cause of it, doth farther confirm the same Truth. And this is the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; That he would give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation.</hi> That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is the immediate Authour of all Super-natural effects and operations in us, hath been elsewhere proved at large. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:200371:30"/> what he is promised or given in the Gospel so to effect, is not any thing that is in our own power. Wherefore the ascription of the <hi>communication of this Ability</hi> unto the Holy Ghost, is a sufficient evidence that we want it in our selves. And all things here affirmed concerning the manner of his communication unto us, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties as communicated, do evidence the Nature, and evince the Truth of the Work ascribed unto him. As for the first, it is by the <hi>grant, donation,</hi> or <hi>free gift</hi> of God the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory would give unto you.</hi> God is called, the <hi>King of Glory, Psal.</hi> 24. 7, 8. and the <hi>God of Glory, Act.</hi> 7. 2. with respect unto his own glorious Majesty. But he is the <hi>Father of Glory,</hi> as he is the Eternal Spring and <hi>cause of all Glory unto the Church.</hi> And these Titles are prefixed unto this grant or the request of it, <hi>the God of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the Father of Glory,</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that it proceeds from his Relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in <hi>Christ,</hi> with that love and bounty wherein he is the cause of all Grace and Glory unto us. Wherefore receiving this Spirit by <hi>free donation,</hi> as we do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. All that we receive from him and by him,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:200371:31"/> we have it by the way of <hi>free gift</hi> or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation also. Therefore is this Ability of <hi>understanding the Scripture,</hi> and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Truth contained therein, a meer <hi>free gift of God,</hi> which he bestows on whom he will. So our Saviour told his Disciples, <hi>unto you it is given to know the Mysteries of God, but to them</hi> (to others) <hi>it is not given, Mat.</hi> 13. 11. who yet heard his words, and understood the literal sense of the propositions used by him as well as the Disciples did. Whoever therefore hath this Ability to know the Mysteries of the Gospel, he hath it by <hi>free Gift,</hi> or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God. He hath received it, and may not boast as if it were from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that he had not received it, as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Again, the properties ascribed unto him, as thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for this End, are <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He is the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom.</hi> So in the communication of him in all fulness unto the Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of the Church, he is called the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Ʋnderstanding, Isa.</hi> 11. 2. and that because he was to make him of <hi>quick understanding in the fear of the Lord, vers.</hi> 3. He is a <hi>Spirit of Wisdom</hi> essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200371:31"/> in himself; and <hi>causally</hi> or efficiently unto others. And these things do mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrate each other. That he is the <hi>cause</hi> of all Wisdom in others, is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that he is <hi>essentially</hi> wise in himself. <hi>For he that planted the ear shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?</hi> And because he is <hi>essentially wise,</hi> he must be the Author of all Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto others. For all good must come from that which is Infinitely, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Unchangeably so, <hi>James</hi> 1. 17. He is therefore called the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom</hi> on both these accounts; as he is <hi>essentially</hi> so in himself, and as he is the <hi>efficient cause</hi> of all Wisdom unto others. And it is in the latter way immediately that he is here so termed. And this Property is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly ascribed unto him as thus given unto us, to <hi>open our eyes,</hi> with respect unto the work which he is to do. For Wisdom is required hereunto. That Wisdom which may deliver us from being really <hi>Fools</hi> our selves, and from judging the things of God to be folly.</p>
               <p>There is a wisdom required hereunto: <hi>Who is wise, and he shall understand these things; Prudent, and he shall know them; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:200371:32"/>
                  <hi>just shall walk in them; but the Transgressors shall fall therein;</hi> Hos. 14. 9. Want of this Wisdome is the cause that Wicked Men take offence at, and dislike the ways of God, because they do not Spiritually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them, and so cast themselves into Destruction. And it is of the same things that the Prophet Affirms, That none <hi>of the Wicked shall understand, but the Wise shall understand;</hi> Dan. 12. 10. And it is called, The <hi>Wisdome of the Just;</hi> Luk. 1. 17.</p>
               <p>This Wisdom is not in us by Nature. Men are naturally wise in their own conceit; which if continued in, is an hopeless frame of Mind, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12. And in nothing doth it more evidence it self, than in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of their own Ability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Spiritual things, and in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of what they do not so; as <hi>folly,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 18, 23. And with respect here. unto, doth the Apostle give that Advice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as our Duty; <hi>Let no man deceive himself, if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this World, let him become a Fool, that he may be Wise,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18. This is a matter wherein Men are very apt to deceive themselves; even to conceit themselves Wise, and to trust thereunto in the things of God, whereof alone he there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200371:32"/> treats. Whereas therefore the especial promise of God is to teach the <hi>meek</hi> and the <hi>humble,</hi> there is nothing that sets men at a greater distance from divine Instruction, than a proud conceit of their own wisdom, wit, parts and abilities. Wherefore this wisdom which is the daugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er of natural darkness, and the mother of proud spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ignorance, the spirit of wisdom freeth the minds of Believers from, in the way that shall be afterwards declared; and therein is he unto us a <hi>Spirit of Wisdom.</hi> Moreover, he gives us that <hi>Wisdom which is from above,</hi> which we are directed to ask of God, <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. Without this Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which he works in us, no man can understand the Wisdom of God in the mystery of the Gospel; whoso is thus made wise, shall understand these things, and none else. There is therefore a <hi>Gift of Spiritual Wisdom</hi> and understanding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary hereunto, that we may discern the <hi>wonderful things</hi> that are in the Word of God. To whom this is not given, they know not the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let men please or pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves whilst they will in their own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and learning, and explode the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these things in our enquiries after the mind of God, the meanest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever who hath received this Wisdom
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:200371:33"/> from above, according unto the measure of the Gift of Christ, knoweth more of the mind of God in a due manner then they do.</p>
               <p>When our Lord Jesus Christ affirmed that he came into the world, <hi>that they which see not, might see,</hi> or to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate spiritual saving light into the minds of men, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who had great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of their own <hi>wisdom</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in the Law, replied with scorn, <hi>And are we blind also? John</hi> 9. 33, 40. I proved no otherwise, and that to their eternal ruine, yet do I not judge all them to be <hi>practically</hi> blind, who do not <hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> own the receiving of this Wisdom and Light from above. For although we make not our selves to differ from others, nor have any thing in a way of spiritual Ability, but what we have received, yet are some apt to <hi>glory</hi> as if they had not received, as the Apostle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Wherefore the Holy Spirit as given unto us, is said to be a <hi>Spirit of Wisdom,</hi> because he <hi>maketh us wise</hi> or worketh wisdom in us. This wisdom we have not of our selves; for to suppose it, renders the Word of God of none effect. And this spiritual wisdom, thus to be bestowed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:200371:33"/> upon us, thus to be wrought in us, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that we mey know the mysteries of the Gospel, or understand the mind of God therein; which is all that we plead for.</p>
               <p>I have insisted the longer upon this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, because the whole of what we assert in general, in the nature, causes, and effects of it, is fully declared therein. And this was the way whereby they of old came to understand divine Revelations, or the mind of God as revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If others who seem to scorn all mention of the <hi>teaching of the Holy Ghost,</hi> have found out a course more expedite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same end, it is what I understand not, nor do desire to participate in.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Holy Spirit is called the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> principally on the same account as God absolutely is, called <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> He is so <hi>essentially.</hi> He is the first, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, divine, eternal Verity; so he is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally called the Holy Spirit on the account of his <hi>essential</hi> Holiness. But it is not on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:200371:34"/> that account solely that he is here called the <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi> He is so as he is the <hi>Revealer</hi> of all divine supernatural Truth unto the Church. As he is also called the Holy Spirit, as he is Author of all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in others; therefore is he here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised unto the Church as it is his work to <hi>lead us into all Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And two things are considerable in this promise; (1.) What is intended by <hi>all Truth.</hi> (2.) How the Holy Spirit <hi>guides</hi> or <hi>leads</hi> us into it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With respect unto the <hi>Object,</hi> it is not <hi>all Truth absolutely</hi> that is intended. There is Truth in things natural, civil, and stories of things that are past; nothing of this nature is comprized in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. We see Believers of all sorts as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, as unacquainted with many of these things, as any other sort of men whatever. Yet doth not one word of the promise of Christ fall unto the ground. Wherefore <hi>all that Truth,</hi> or all Truth of that nature whereof our Saviour there speaketh, is alone intended. The myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel, of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Counsel of God about the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church by Christ, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their faith and obedience, are the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:200371:35"/>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> which he is promised to guide us into. This the Apostle calleth, <hi>All the Counsel of God, Acts</hi> 20. 27. namely, which respects all the Ends of our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It admits of a <hi>Limitation</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the diversity of subjects, or the persons unto whom this Truth is to be communicated. They are not all of them as to the <hi>degrees</hi> of light and knowledge <hi>equally</hi> to be lead into all Truth. Every one unto whom he is thus promised, shall be so far lead into the knowledge of it, as is necessary unto his own estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, his duty and his work. For unto <hi>every one of us is given grace according unto the measure of the gift of Christ, Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. It is Christ alone, who in the free gift of all grace, <hi>assigns the measures</hi> wherein every one shall be made partaker of it. In his Soveraign Will he hath allotted the measures of grace, light and knowledge unto all the members of the Church. And there is no less difference in <hi>these measures,</hi> then in the knowledge of the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Apostle, and that of the meanest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the World. The duty, work and obedience of every one, is the <hi>Rule of the measure</hi> of his receiving these gifts of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:200371:35"/> Christ. None shall want anything that is necessary unto him; none shall receive any thing that he is not to use and improve in a way of duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our second Enquiry is, how the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth thus <hi>lead us</hi> into all Truth. The external Revelation of Truth is herein sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. This he is promised to instruct us in the knowledge of, in a spiritual manner, whereby I understand no more, but so as it is required of us in a way of duty. To clear the Truth hereof, some things must be observed. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The promises concerning the <hi>mission of the Holy Spirit</hi> in these <hi>Chapters of the Gospel,</hi> 14, 15, 16. are not to be confined unto the <hi>Apostles,</hi> nor unto the <hi>first Age or Ages of the Church.</hi> To do so is expresly contradictory unto the Discourse and whole design of our Lord Jesus Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that purpose. For he promiseth him in opposition unto his own temporary abode in the world; namely, that this of the Spirit should <hi>be for ever, Chap.</hi> 14, 16. that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>consummation</hi> of the whole State of the Church here below. And to suppose the contrary, is to overthrow the foundation of all Truth and Comfort in the Church. For their preservation in the one, and the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:200371:36"/> administration of the other unto them, depend on the accomplishment of this promise alone. And so also do all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Intercession of Christ, which are no otherwise communicated unto us, but by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as given in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of this promise. For what herein he prayed for his Apostles, he prayed <hi>for all them that should believe in him through this word unto the end of the world, Joh.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is granted, that sundry things in the promises of the Holy Ghost were <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> unto the Apostles, and had their accomplishment on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when he descended on them in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious visible manner, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. For as they were commanded by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>to wait for this his coming</hi> before they ingaged in the discharge of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice whereunto he had called them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4. So now they were fully enpowered and enabled unto all that belonged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But their peculiar interest in these promises, respected only things that were peculiar unto their Office; such as that mentioned in this place is not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not an <hi>External Guidance</hi> into the Truth by the objective Revelation of it, that is intended; For such Revelations are not granted unto all Believers unto whom
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:200371:36"/> this promise is made, nor are they to look for them. And the Revelation of Truth in the Ministerial proposal of it, is common unto all the world unto whom the Word is preached, and so is not the subject of an especial promise.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore it is the <hi>internal teaching</hi> of the Holy Ghost giving an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mind of God, of all sacred Truths as revealed, that is intended. For, (1.) It is the same with that other promise, we <hi>shall be all taught of God.</hi> For we are thus taught of God by the <hi>Spirit's leading us into all Truth,</hi> and no otherwise. (2.) This the Word enforceth; The Spirit of Truth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, shall <hi>lead and guide you in the right way</hi> to the knowledge of the Truth. So when <hi>Philip</hi> asked the <hi>Eunuch</hi> whether he understood the things which he read out of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> he replieth, <hi>How can I?</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 31. <hi>unless one lead me</hi> to the sense of it; that is by his interpretation give me an understanding of it. Thus the Holy Spirit leads us into all Truth by giving us that understanding of it, which of our selves we are not able to attain. And other Interpretations the words will not admit. It is therefore his work to give us
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:200371:37"/> an useful saving understanding of all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Truth, or the mind of God as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture. All spiritual <hi>Divine supernatural Truth</hi> is revealed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Herein all are agreed. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the <hi>right understanding</hi> of this Truth as so revealed, is the duty of all, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the means which they enjoy, and the duties that are required of them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can this be denied. Unto this end that they may do so, the Holy Spirit is here <hi>promised unto them that do believe.</hi> His Divine Aid and Assistance is therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary hereunto. And this we are to <hi>pray for,</hi> as it is promised. Wherefore of our selves, without his especial Assistance and Guidance, we cannot attain a due know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and understanding in the Truth revealed in the Scripture As unto the especial nature of this Assistance it shall be spoken unto afterwards.</p>
               <p>This is again affirmed concerning all Believers, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20, 27. <hi>You have an Ʋnction from the Holy One, and you know all things; the anointing which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him abideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth, and is no lye; and even as it hath</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:200371:37"/>
                  <hi>taught you, ye shall abide in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That by the <hi>Ʋnction</hi> and Anointing in in this place the Spirit of God and his work, with respect unto the end mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are intended, is not questioned by any that are conversant about these things with sobriety. And it is plain in the Text. For (1.) That the Holy Spirit in his especial operations, is called an <hi>Ʋnction,</hi> or is said to <hi>anoint</hi> us, is evident in many places of the Scripture. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22, 23. Neither is a spiritual Unction ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing else in the whole Scripture. (2.) That expression <hi>which you have from the Holy One (Acts</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7.) that is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> doth expresly answer unto the promise of Christ, to send his Holy Spirit unto us, and that for the end here mentioned, namely, to teach us, and lead us into all Truth; whence he is called <hi>the Spirit of the Lord</hi> or of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Ephess.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19, &amp;c. That also of his <hi>abiding in us,</hi> is nothing but an expression of the same promise of Christ, that he shall <hi>abide with us for ever, John</hi> 14. 16. (4.) The work here assigned unto this <hi>Ʋnction,</hi> is expresly assigned unto the Holy Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. The <hi>Spirit of Truth shall guide you into all Truth.</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:200371:38"/> (5.) What is said of it, namely, not only that <hi>it is true, and not false,</hi> but that it is <hi>Truth, and no lye,</hi> doth plainly intimate his <hi>essential</hi> verity. And I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that any persons should against this open and plain Evidence, ascribe the things here mentioned unto any thing else, and that exclusively unto the Holy Ghost. For so do some contend <hi>(Episcop. in loc.</hi> after <hi>Socir.</hi> on the same place) that by this Unction the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospel only</hi> is intended. It is true that the Doctrine of the Gospel in the preaching of it, is the means or instrumental cause of this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Holy Ghost. And on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what is spoken of the Teaching of the Spirit of God, may be spoken in its place of the Doctrine of the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he teacheth us thereby. But here it is spoken of <hi>objectively,</hi> as what we are to be taught, and not <hi>efficiently,</hi> as what it is that teacheth us. And to say as they do, it is the instruction which we have by the Gospel that is intended, is to assert the <hi>Effect</hi> only, and to <hi>exclude</hi> the Cause. For that siguifies no more, but the effect of the Unction here ascribed unto Believers, as that which they had received from the Holy One. <hi>Dydimus,</hi> an antient learned
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:200371:38"/> Writer, interpreteth this <hi>Ʋnction</hi> to be the <hi>Illuminating Grace</hi> of the Spirit, and the <hi>Holy One</hi> to be the <hi>Spirit himself, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Spir. Sanct.</hi> But the other Interpretation is more proper and consonant unto the use of the Scripture. The expression is taken from the Institution of God under the Old Testament, whereby Kings and Priests are <hi>anointed</hi> with Oil, to signifie the gifts of the Spirit communicated unto them for the discharge of their Office. And thence Believers who are real partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Ʋnction</hi> in the graces and gifts of the Holy Ghost, are said to be <hi>made Kings and Priests unto God.</hi> It is therefore the Work of the Holy Spirit that is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. He alone with his Gifts, Graces, and Priviledges that ensue thereon, are so expressed, here or any where else in the whole Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Two things are to be observed in what is here ascribed unto this Unction. <hi>First,</hi> What is the <hi>Effect</hi> of his Work in Believers. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the <hi>nature</hi> of it, or how he produceth that Effect.</p>
               <p>For the First, there is a double Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; (1.) <hi>That they know all things.</hi> (2.) That they <hi>need not that any should teach them;</hi> both which expressions admit of,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:200371:39"/> yea require their Limitations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>all things</hi> intended come under a double restriction: the first taken from the <hi>nature</hi> of the things themselves; the other from the <hi>Scope</hi> and circumstances of the place: or, the one from the general End, the other from the special design pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>General End</hi> proposed, is our <hi>abiding in Christ.</hi> So <hi>ye shall abide in him;</hi> which the Apostle expresseth, <hi>verse</hi> 24. by <hi>continuing in the Son, and in the Father.</hi> Wherefore, the <hi>all things</hi> here mentioned, are all things necessary unto our ingrafting into and continuance in Christ. Such are all the Fundamental, yea, important truths of the Gospel. Whatever is needful unto our Communion with Christ, and our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, this all true Believers are taught; However, they may mistake in things of <hi>lesser moment,</hi> and be ignorant in the Doctrine of some Truths, or have but mean degrees of knowledge in any thing, yet shall they all know the Mind and Will of God as revealed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, in all those things and Truths which are necessary, that they may believe unto Righteousness, and make Confession unto Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:200371:39"/> 2. The <hi>especial End,</hi> under considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Preservation and Deliverance from the <hi>Antichrists,</hi> and Seducers of those dayes, with the Errors, Lyes, and false Doctrines which they divulged, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ and the Gospel. The only way and means whereby we may be so preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Poysons and Infections of such pernicious Opinions and ways, is the assured knowledge of the Truths of the Gospel, as they are revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. All those Truths which were any way needful to secure their Faith, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from <hi>mortal</hi> seductions, they were taught and did know. And where any man knows the Truths which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unto his Implantation into Christ, and his continuance with him in Faith and Obedience; as also, all those which may preserve him from the danger of seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into pernicious Errors; however he may fail and be mistaken in some things of less importance; yet is he secured as unto his present acceptable Obedience, and future Blessedness. And to speak of it by the way, this giveth us the <hi>Rule of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special communion and love.</hi> Where any are <hi>taught</hi> these things, where they have the knowledge, and make Confession of that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:200371:40"/> Truth, or those Articles of Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may <hi>abide in Christ,</hi> and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>from pernicious seductions,</hi> although they may differ from us and the Truth in some things of less moment; we are obliged not only to forbearance of them, but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with them: For who shall refuse them, whom Christ hath received? or doth Christ refuse any to whom he gives his Spirit, who have the <hi>Ʋnction</hi> from the Holy One? This, and no other is the Rule of our <hi>Evangelical Love</hi> and Communion among our selves. Whatever we require more of any as a necessary condition of our Christians Society in point of Doctrine, is an unwarrantable <hi>imposition</hi> on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences or practice, or both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> It is said, that they so know these things, as that they <hi>need not that any should teach them;</hi> which also requireth a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Exposition. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is only the things as before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that respect is had unto. Now besides these, there are many other things which Believers stand in need to be taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; and whose knowledge belongs unto their <hi>Edification.</hi> Many things are very <hi>useful</hi> unto us, that are not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>necessary.</hi> In natural things, and such as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:200371:40"/> belong unto this present Life: Men would be very unwilling to be without, or part with sundry things without which, yet Life might be preserved, because they value them, as of use unto themselves, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to be useful unto others. And they who understand the Nature, Use, and Benefit of <hi>Evangelical Truths,</hi> will not be contented that their knowledge in them should be confined only unto those which are of <hi>absolute necessity</hi> unto the Being of Spiritual Life. Yea, they cannot be well supposed to know those Truths themselves, who pretend such a satisfaction in them as to look no father. For all who are sincere in Faith and Knowledge, do aime at that <hi>perfect man in Christ,</hi> which all the Ordinances of God are designed to bring us unto, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 13. Wherefore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the knowledg of these things, there is still use and need of further Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Teaching in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is spoken of the things themselves <hi>absolutely,</hi> and not with respect unto the <hi>degrees</hi> of the knowledge of them. They did so know them, as there was no need that any man should teach them unto them, as unto their <hi>initial Knowledge</hi> and substance of the things themselves; and so it may be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:200371:41"/> said of all Believers. But yet there are <hi>degrees of knowledge</hi> with respect unto those very things, which they may and ought to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on unto, as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. And therefore doth the Holy Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who writes these things, <hi>farther instruct</hi> them in them. And herein consists the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Ministery of the Church, even to carry on Believers unto Perfection, in those things wherein for the Substance of them, they have been already instructed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which is principally intended, is that they need not that any should teach them, so as that they should depend on the Light and <hi>Authority</hi> of their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Others may be helpers of their joy, but none can be Lords of their Faith. You need no such teaching because of the <hi>Ʋncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which you have received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> For the general nature of the Work here ascribed unto this <hi>Ʋnction,</hi> that is the Holy Spirit, it is <hi>Teaching; The Ʋnction teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you.</hi> There are but two ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Spirit teacheth us; nor can any other be conceived. The one is by <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,</hi> the other by <hi>Subjective</hi> Revelations. For he teacheth us as a Spirit of <hi>Wisdom and Revelation.</hi> The first way of his Teaching is, by immediate Inspiration,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:200371:41"/> communicating new Sacred Truths from God immediately unto the Minds of Men. So he taught the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> and all the Penmen of the Scripture. By him the Word of the Lord came unto them, and they spake as they were <hi>acted</hi> by him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21 This is not the way of Teaching here intended. For, the End of this Teaching of the Holy Ghost is only to make Men Teachers of others, which is not here intended. Nor doth the Apostle discourse unto any such purpose; as though God would grant <hi>new Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> unto Men, to preserve them from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Seductions, which he hath made sufficient provision for in the Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1▪ 19. By this Word were they to try all Doctrines and pretended Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea they which were so really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they received them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what is here affirmed, is ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all sorts of Believers, under the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution which they are cast into by the Apostle, namely, of <hi>Old-Men, Young-Men,</hi> and <hi>Babes</hi> which had not all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of immediate Revelation.</p>
               <p>His other way of Teaching is, that which we have insisted on; namely, his enabling us to discern, know, and understand the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:200371:42"/> Mind and Will of God, as Revealed in the Scripture, or as declared in any Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; This alone is, or can be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Wherefore this is the Design of the Apostle, in these words; <hi>All divine Truths necessary to be known, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that we may live unto God in Faith and Obedience or come unto, and abide in Christ; as also, be preserved from Seducers, are contained in the Scripture, or proposed unto us in divine Revelations. These of our selves we cannot understand, unto the Ends mentioned; for if we could, there would be no need that we should be taught them by the Holy Spirit. But this is so, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us all these things, enabling us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, comprehend, and acknowledge them.</hi> And this is the whole of what we plead for.</p>
               <p>For a close of our considerations on these words of the Apostle, I shall only observe what <hi>Assurance</hi> a man that is thus taught the Truth, may have, that it is the Truth which he is taught, and that he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his apprehensions of it. For hereon depends the use of this Instruction; especially in times of trial, indeed at all times and on all occasions. It is not enough that we know the Truth, but we must be assured, that so we do. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:200371:42"/>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. And there was never a greater <hi>Artifice</hi> in the World, then that whereby the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath imposed an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable obstinate credulity on all that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here thereunto. For it doth first fix this in their Minds, that it self <hi>cannot Erre,</hi> and therefore whatever is by her Authority proposed unto them, is infallibly true. Hence it comes to pass that they will abide obstinate against all convictions, and the highest Evidence of Truth in all particular instances, whilst this principle is firmly fixed in their minds, that the Church which proposeth these things unto them <hi>cannot Erre,</hi> nor be mistaken. Yea, whilst this perswasion abides with them, they may be, and indeed accordingly are, obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Contradictions; things most irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and absurd, inconsistent with Christian Piety, and the peace of Humane Society. However, they say well in this, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that a man should have <hi>good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of the Truth which he doth profess, or of his own understanding of it, and conception about it. This the Apostle calleth, the <hi>Riches of the full assurance of Ʋnderstanding,</hi> Col. 2. 2. whereof we shall speak afterwards.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, whereas the Assurance of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:200371:43"/> Mind, in other Teachings depend much on the <hi>Authority</hi> of them by whom they are taught; on a supposition that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are taught the Mind of God in the Scripture by the Holy Spirit, or are by him enabled to discern and know it; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is, how, or by what means they have an <hi>Assurance</hi> that they have a <hi>right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> of the things which they are so taught, so as to abide in them, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of them, against all opposition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and so as to venture the Eternal condition of their Souls on <hi>that Assurance</hi> they have of the Truth; which every one must do, whether he will or no. And this in the Text is referred unto the Author of this Teaching. <hi>For the anointing is Truth, and is no Lye;</hi> it is true and infallibly so. There is no fear of, no possibility for any man to be deceived in what he is taught by this <hi>Ʋnction.</hi> And an assurance hereof ariseth in our Minds, partly from the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of his Teachings, and partly from the <hi>evidence</hi> of the things themselves that we are taught. The manner and way of his teaching us in and by the Scripture, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth unto us, that what we are taught is <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>no lye.</hi> He giveth a <hi>secret Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> unto what he teacheth in his Teachings.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:200371:43"/>
                  <hi>For it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is Truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 6. And with respect unto the Evidence which is so given us of the Truth, it is said, That the <hi>Ʋnction</hi> whereby we are taught <hi>is Truth, and no Lye;</hi> that is, it is impossible any one should be deceived who is so taught. This will more fully appear when we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the whole of his work herein; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing only may now be spoken on occasion of this Testimony.</p>
               <p>There is a peculiar power accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Teaching of God by his Spirit. <hi>Behold, God exalteth by his power, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like him?</hi> Job 36. 22. So our Saviour expoundeth that Promise, <hi>They shall be all taught of God; every man,</hi> saith he, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard and learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh unto me,</hi> Joh. 6. 45. There is such an Efficacy accompanying of Gods Teaching, that whosoever is so taught, doth certainly believe the things that he is taught, as having the Evidence of the Truth of them in himself.</p>
               <p>When the Holy Ghost gave <hi>new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Old unto the Prophets and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Scripture by <hi>immediate Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> he did therein and therewith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto them an infallible Evidence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:200371:44"/> that they were from God. And when he doth <hi>illuminate our Minds</hi> in the knowledg of what is revealed, he doth therein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bear witness unto, and assure us of the Truth which we do understand. Hereby do we come to that which the Apostle calleth the <hi>full assurance of Ʋnderstanding in the acknowledgement of the Mystery of God.</hi> He not only enableth our minds to apprehend the Truth, but <hi>he shines into our hearts,</hi> the seat of Spiritual Experience, to give us the <hi>knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> And the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which Believers have thereby, is above that which any other Evidence or Demonstration whatever can give. And the meanest Believer hath from this Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a greater rest, satisfaction, and assurance in the knowledge of the Mind of God, than any can be attained by the most raised Notions, or profound Disputations; <hi>for he that believeth, hath the witness in himself;</hi> 1 John 5. 10. And why should others think it strange, that there should be that Evidence of Truth in the Teachings of the Spirit, by the Illumination of our Minds in the knowledge of the Scripture, as to give us an assurance of the highest Nature, <hi>seeing there is none that teacheth like him?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:200371:44"/>
               <p> Want hereof, is that which makes Men to fluctuate in their conceptions of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, and so ready on every occasion to part with what they have received. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, as we observed, rather <hi>craftily,</hi> then <hi>wisely</hi> provided against any inconvenience herein. The Doctrines which it teacheth are many of them false; and so the things contained in them can give no Evidence unto themselves in the minds of Men. For there is nothing but <hi>imagination</hi> in Error, there is nothing of Substance in it. And their <hi>way of Teaching</hi> is not accompanied with any especial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yea it is the most vain that ever was in the World. They would have men suppose that they may advance at once in the true belief of an <hi>hundred things</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have no Evidence, meerly resting on the Infallibility of the Church, by which, they say, They are <hi>proposed.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they teach Men that although they receive no Evidencing Light, in this way of their instruction, nor have any experience of the Power or Efficacy of Truth in what they are taught, yet they may rest assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly in the <hi>Infallibility of the Church.</hi> Hence the Assurance they have of any thing they suppose Truth, is not an act of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200371:45"/> Mind in the embracing of the Truth, from any Evidence that it gives of it self, but a presumption in general that the <hi>Church is Infallible,</hi> by which these things are proposed unto them. The Design is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Men, to suppose that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>all things,</hi> when indeed they believe <hi>nothing:</hi> that they understand the Mind and Will of God, when indeed they understand nothing at all of them. For a man believes nothing but what is accompanied with an Evidence whereon it ought to be believed. But this they pretend not unto, at least, not such that should give them that assurance of the Truth of it, which is requisite; and therefore are all men by them referred for that, unto the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church. Persons weak, ignorant, credulous, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, either for Interest, or by the craft of Seducers, may be prevailed on to make their resort unto this Relief; those who will not rationally forego the conduct of their own Souls, and leave themselves unto the Guidance of, others knowing that it is they alone, who must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of themselves, to God; will not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be induced thereunto.</p>
               <p>Others, will resolve all into their own <hi>rational conceptions</hi> of things, without any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:200371:45"/> respect unto a Superiour Infallible Teacher. And the minds of many influenced by this Notion, That <hi>they have themselves alone to trust unto,</hi> are come unto the utmost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and Infalibillity in all things of Religion; nor can it otherwise be. For the mind of Man is in it self as indifferent and undetermined unto any thing, as true, or false, (unless it be in its first Notions of the common principles of Reason) beyond the Evidence that is proposed unto it: so also is it <hi>various, unsteady,</hi> and apt to fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from one thing to another. And there are but two ways whereby it may be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ascertained, and determined in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and assent. The first is by the use of the <hi>External senses,</hi> which will not deceive it; however it cannot but receive, believe, and comply with what it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends by its <hi>Senses;</hi> as what it sees, hears, and feels. The other is by <hi>Reason,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it deduceth certain Conclusions, from propositions of necessary Truth; that is, by <hi>Demonstration.</hi> But by neither of these ways can the Mind be brought unto a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and <hi>Assurance</hi> in or about things Spiritual or Supernatural. For they are neither the Objects of <hi>Natural</hi> sense, nor capable of a <hi>Scientifical</hi> Demonstration.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:200371:46"/> Wherefore a man can have nothing but a probability or conjectural knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, unless he have some certain <hi>Infallible Teaching</hi> wherein he can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce. And such is that of this <hi>Ʋnction,</hi> which is <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>no Lye.</hi> In and by his Teaching of us, namely, the Mind of God as revealed in the Scripture, there is that evidence of Truth communicated unto our minds and hearts, as giveth us an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable assurance of them, or the <hi>full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of understanding.</hi> For God therein shines into our hearts, to give us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Glory in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Again, there is an evidence in the things themselves, unto <hi>spiritual sense and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Phil.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. last. This is that which gives the mind the higest assurance of the Truth of what it doth believe, that it is capable of in this World. For when it <hi>finds in it self</hi> the power and efficacy of the Truth wherein it is instructed, that it worketh, effecteth, and implanteth the things themselves upon it, giving and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining unto it all the benefits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which they promise or express, and is thereby united unto the soul, or hath a real, permanent, efficacious subsistence in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:200371:46"/> it; then, I say, hath the mind the utmost assurance in the Truth of it, which it doth or can desire in the things of this nature. but this belongs not unto our present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
               <p>The Testimonies pleaded are sufficient for the confirmation of our first general Assertion, namely, <hi>That it is the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who teacheth us to understand aright the Mind and Will of God in the Scripture, without whose aid and assistance we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do so usefully nor profitably unto our own souls.</hi> Sundry others that speak unto the same purpose will be afterwards on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occasions insisted on.</p>
               <p>I might add unto these Testimonies, the Faith and Profession of the Church in all Ages. They all believed and professed, that the Scriptures could not be understood and interpreted without his assistance and inspiration by whom they were indited. But it is not necessary so to do. For those who profess a <hi>Trust</hi> unto their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and understanding only, cannot be so ignorant as not to know that they have no countenance given unto their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in <hi>Antiquity,</hi> unless it were by the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> But whereas there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable handling of sacred Truths on any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200371:47"/> pretence, but with an Eye unto the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Christian Practice; and when that is manifest, it gives a great confirmation in our minds unto the Truth it self. I shall before I proceed unto the consideration of the <hi>especial ways</hi> of the <hi>Teaching of the Holy Spirit</hi> in this matter, and the <hi>especial duties</hi> required of us in compliance with them, that they may be Effectual, divert a little unto some such considerations of that nature, as derive from this general Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is the great Promise of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That all Believers shall be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>taught of God;</hi> which our Saviour himself pleads, as the only Ground of their Believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. And so the Apostle tells the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Taught of God.</hi> No Man is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> taught of himself, his own Teacher and Guide in Sacred things. Neither can any man have a worse Master, if he trust thereunto alone. The diligent use of all outward means appointed of God unto this End, that through the Knowledge of the Scripture we may be made Wise unto Salvation; we always suppose. Amongst them the <hi>Ministry of the Church</hi> hath the first and chiefest place,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:200371:47"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14, 15. For they are with me of no account, who think it not worth the utmost of their diligence to attain the knowledge of those <hi>wonderful things</hi> that are in the Word. Yea I should greatly admire at their stupidity, who will not give so much <hi>credit unto the Scripture</hi> testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self, and the suffrage of all good men with it, that there are <hi>wonderful things</hi> contained in it, so far as to enquire with their utmost diligence, whether it be so or no, but that I know the Reasons and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of it. But <hi>a Supream Teacher</hi> there must be, on whose Wisdome, Power, and Authority we ought principally to depend, as unto this End, of being Taught of God. And hereunto the use of our own Reason, the utmost improvement of the rational Abilities of our minds, is required. Those who would take away the <hi>use of our Reason</hi> in Spiritual things, would deal with us as we said before, as the <hi>Philistines</hi> did with <hi>Sampson;</hi> first put out our Eyes, and then make us grinde in their Mill. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we own as the only Rule of our Faith, as the only Treasury of all Sacred Truths. The Knowledge we aim at, is the <hi>full assurance of Ʋnderstanding</hi> in the Mind and Will of God revealed therein.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200371:48"/> The sole Enquiry is, whether this supream Teacher be the Spirit of God instructing us in and by the Scripture, or whether it be the Authority of this or that, any, or all of the Churches in the world, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are so, or pretend to be so. Which of these will it be our wisdom to chuse and adhere unto? That the Holy Spirit hath taken this work upon himself, we have already proved, and shall afterwards farther demonstrate: Some Churches, especially that of <hi>Rome,</hi> assume this Office unto themselves. But it is too well known to the most to be trusted herein. And a great prejudice there lieth in this cause against that Church at first. The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit leaves unto us, yea requires of us the <hi>diligent</hi> use of the Scripture, and exercise of our own reason in subserviency unto his Teaching. But this Church requires us to renounce them <hi>both,</hi> in compliance with her self. And can it stand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with him? He is infallible, the <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is Truth, and it is no lye; the Spirit is Truth. This also indeed that <hi>Church pretends</hi> unto; but with such an open af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front unto all evidence of Truth, as the world never underwent from any of its people before. He is absolutely, infinitely;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:200371:48"/> eternally <hi>free from any design,</hi> but the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the present and eternal Good of them that are instructed by him. It will be very difficult for those of <hi>Rome</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend hereunto. Yea, it is apparent, that all the Exercise of their <hi>instructing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> lyeth in a subserviency unto their own Interest. When I see that men by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence hereof, have gotten unto themselves <hi>Wealth, Power, Principalities, Dominions,</hi> with great Revenues, and do use them all unto their own advantage, and mostly to the satisfaction of their Lusts, Pleasures, Pride, Ambition, and the like inordinate Affections, I confess I cannot be free to deliver up blindfold the conduct of my Soul unto them. He is full of <hi>divine Love</hi> and care of the Souls of them whom he doth instruct; is it so with them, or can any Creature participate in his Love and care? He is infinitely Wise, and <hi>knoweth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> and can make known what he pleaseth of them unto us: as the Apostle discourseth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. They who preside in that Church are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant themselves as all men are, and the less they know it, the more ignorant they are; yea, for the most part as unto <hi>sacred things</hi> they are comparatively so, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:200371:49"/> unto other ordinary men. As a late <hi>Pope,</hi> when some of their Divines waited for an Infallible determination of a <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Controversie</hi> among them, confessed, That <hi>he had not studied those things, nor had the knowledge of them been his Profession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet notwithstanding, these and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other differences between these <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;</hi> it is marvellous to consider how many betake themselves unto the <hi>latter of them,</hi> and how few unto the <hi>former.</hi> And the Reason is, because of the different <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> they take in Teaching, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>qualifications</hi> they require in them that are to be Taught For as unto them whom the Spirit of God undertaketh to instruct, he requireth that they be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> that they give themselves unto <hi>continual prayer, meditation,</hi> and study in the Word <hi>day and night;</hi> above all that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a conformity in their whole Souls and Lives unto the Truths that he instructs them in. These are hard conditions unto <hi>flesh and blood;</hi> few there are who like them, and therefore few they are who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the <hi>School of God.</hi> We may be admitted <hi>Schollers</hi> by the other <hi>Teacher</hi> on far cheaper and easier rates. Men may be made good <hi>Catholicks</hi> as to Faith and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:200371:49"/> without the least cost in <hi>self-denial,</hi> or much trouble unto the Flesh in any other duty. There is no qualification required for the admission of a Man into the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools,</hi> and barely to be there, is to be wise and knowing enough. Wherefore although all advantages imaginable as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Teachers</hi> lye on the one hand, yet the pretended easie way of learning casts the multitude on the other. For it requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more Wisdom then we have of our selves, to be at all that charge and paines in spiritual duty, and diligence in the use of all means for the right understanding of the Mind of God, which is required in and of all them, who will advantagiously partake of the Teachings of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; when it is supposed we may have all the Ends which we aime at thereby, in an easie and naked assent unto the proposals of the Church, without the least farther charge or trouble. But these are the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>slothful and carnal Minds,</hi> who prefer their Ease, their Lusts and Pleasures before their Souls. There is difficulty in all things that are excellent. Neither can we partake of the excellency of any thing unless we will undertake its difficulty. But although the ways whereby we may come
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:200371:50"/> unto a participation of the Teaching of the Holy Ghost, seem at first rough and uneasie, yet unto all that ingage in them, they will be found to be, <hi>ways of pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and paths of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be said, That it is evident in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience, that many men do attain a great knowledge and skill in the things revealed in the Scripture, without any of that Internal Teaching by the <hi>Illumination</hi> of their Minds, which is pleaded for; Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be to be obtained by the means now intimated, and afterwards more fully to be declared. For they themselves do renounce the necessity of any such Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and esteem all that is spoken of it a vain imagination; and not only so, but live some of them in an open defiance of all those qualifications and duties which are required unto a participation of these Teachings. Yet it is foolish to pretend they are not skilled in the knowledge of <hi>Divinity,</hi> seeing it is plain that they excel most other men therein; and therefore do sufficiently despise all them who pretend unto any benefit by the <hi>Supernatural Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> contended for.</p>
               <p>I answer briefly in this place; It is true there are, and ever were, some, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:200371:50"/> who <hi>profess that they know God, but in Works deny him being abominable and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient.</hi> The Knowledge which such men may attain, and which they make Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, belongs not unto our enquiry; And we may easily discern both what it is in its self, and wherein it differs from that true knowledge of God, which it is our duty to have. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is in the Scripture with respect unto the Mind and Will of God revealed therein, with the Mysteries of Truth and Grace, mention of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>acknowledgment.</hi> The former if it be alone, affects only the <hi>speculative part</hi> of the Mind with notions of Truth. And it is of very little use, but subject unto the highest abuse; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is that which <hi>puffs up men</hi> into all their proud contentions about Religion, which the World is filled withal.

It is not worth disputing at all, what knowledge of the first kind, or what degree therein, men, any men, the worst of men may attain by their industry and skill in other common Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. For what if they should make such a proficiency therein, as to be filled with pride in themselves, and to confound others with their subtle Disputations? will any real profit redound hence unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or the world or the Church of God? It doth not therefore deserve the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about it. But that <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of the Truth which affects the heart, and conforms the soul unto the Will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, is not attainable in any degree without the <hi>saving Illumination</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men may have a knowledge of <hi>words,</hi> and the <hi>meaning</hi> of propositions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, who have no knowledge of the <hi>things themselves</hi> designed in them. The things revealed in the Scripture are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in propositions whose words and tearms are intelligible unto the common Reason of mankind. Every rational man, especially if he be skilled in those <hi>common Sciences and Arts</hi> which all writings refer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:200371:51"/> unto, may without any especial aid of the Holy Ghost, know the meaning of the <hi>Propositions</hi> that are laid down in, or drawn from the Scripture. Yea they can do so, who believe not one word of it to be true; and they do so, as well as the best of them who have no <hi>other help</hi> in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, but their own Reason, let them profess to believe what they will And whatever men understand of the meaning of the words, <hi>Expressions</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> in the Scripture, if they believe not the <hi>things</hi> which they declare, they do not in any sense <hi>know the Mind and Will of God</hi> in them. For to know a thing as the mind of God, and not to assent unto its Truth, implieth a contradiction. I shall never grant that a man understands the Scripture aright, who understands the words of it only, and not the things which is the mind of God in them. For instance, the <hi>Jews</hi> understand the words of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of the Old Testament in its own ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal language. And they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>grammatical sense</hi> and constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Propositions contained in it. They are unacquainted with them, and their Writings, who will not acknowledge their skill, subtilty and accuracy in these
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:200371:52"/> things. Yet will not any Christian say they <hi>understand the Mind of God</hi> in the Old Testament: The Apostle sheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and giveth the reason for it in the place before insisted on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Such a knowledge of the Scripture no wise man will value, let it be attained how it will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This knowledge that may be thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained doth only <hi>inform the mind</hi> in the way of an <hi>Artificial Science,</hi> but doth not really <hi>illuminate</hi> it. And to this end men have turned <hi>Divinity</hi> into an <hi>Art</hi> like other common humane Arts and Sciences, and so they learnt it instead of <hi>a Spiritual Wisdom and Ʋnderstanding of Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</hi> It is true, that the knowledge of common learned Arts and Sciences is of great use unto the understanding of the Scripture, as unto what they have in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with other writings, and what they refer unto that is of humane cognisance; but to bring in all the tearms, notions and rules of those <hi>Arts and Sciences into Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and by the mixture of them with it, to compose a <hi>Scheme</hi> of Divine Knowledge, is all one as if a man should design to make up his <hi>house</hi> of the <hi>Scaffolds,</hi> which he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly useth in the building of it. Such is that knowledge of the mind of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:200371:52"/> which many aim at, and content themselves withall. And it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as any other <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> may, without any supernatural aid of the Holy Spirit, and is sufficient to <hi>drive a trade with,</hi> which, as things are stated in the world, men may use and exercise unto their great advantage. But, as was said before, it was not that which we enquire after. That Wisdom in the mystery of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that knowledge of the mind and will of God in the Scripture which <hi>affects the heart,</hi> and <hi>transforms the mind</hi> in the Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it unto the approbation of the good, acceptable and perfect will of God, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. is alone valuable and desirable, as unto all spiritual and eternal ends.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It doth not give <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>all riches of full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. The Apostle speaks: It gives unto men no other assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mind in the things that they know, but what they have from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged principles and conclusions drawn from them, in any other Science. But that knowledge which men have of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:200371:53"/> of the Gospel by the teaching and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the Holy Spirit, gives them <hi>the riches of assurance of understanding</hi> of an higher nature, even the assurance of Faith. That assurance I say which Believers have in spiritual things, is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind, then can be attained out of conclusions that are only rationally derived from the most evident principles. And therefore doth it produce effects of another nature both in doing and in suffering For this is that which effectually and infallibly puts them on all those duties and that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in self-denial, and the mortification of sin, which the world either knoweth not or despiseth. <hi>For he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as God is pure,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3: And this also enables them chearfully and joyfully to suffer all that the world can inflict on them for the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those Truths whereof they have that <hi>Assurance.</hi> But nothing of this ensues on that common knowledge which men may have from themselves of sacred things. For,</p>
               <p n="5">5. It doth not enable men to <hi>Trust in God,</hi> and ad here firmly unto him by love. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaking unto God, saith, <hi>They that know thy Name will put their trust in</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:200371:53"/>
                  <hi>thee, Psal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>To know the Name of God,</hi> is to know the Revelations that he hath made of himself, his mind and his will in the Scripture. They that have this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he affirms, <hi>will put their trust in him.</hi> Therefore it is certain that those who <hi>put not their trust in God,</hi> have not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him. There is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a knowledge falsely so called,</hi> which hath nothing of real spiritual knowledge but the name. And it is generally much given to disputing, or the maintaining of <hi>Antithes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses,</hi> or oppositions unto the Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. But it is <hi>falsly</hi> called <hi>knowledge,</hi> in as much as those in whom it is, do neither <hi>trust</hi> in God, nor <hi>adhere</hi> unto him in love. And we shall not much enquire, by what means such a knowledge may be acquired.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore notwithstanding this Objection, that all real useful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>wonderful things</hi> that are in the Scripture, is an effect of God's <hi>opening our eyes</hi> by the illuminating grace of his Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>And this will enable us <hi>to try the Spirits,</hi> as we are commanded of many amongst us. For some there are who at once have cast off a due respect unto their <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide,</hi> the Scripture and holy Spirit of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:200371:54"/> God. Some formerly have pretended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a guidance by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as that they have neglected or rejected the <hi>written Word.</hi> And some pretend such an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the <hi>Word</hi> and such an ability in their own minds and reasons to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, as to despise the <hi>Teaching of the Spirit.</hi> Others reject both the one and the other, betaking themselves unto another <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide,</hi> whereunto they ascribe all that belongs unto either or both of them. But a wandring <hi>Light</hi> it hath proved unto them, that hath lead them into a bog of many vain imaginations and corrupt Opinions. And it is fallen out with them as might be expected. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> be promised <hi>to lead us into all Truth,</hi> yet is he so in an especial manner unto those which concern the person, offices and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ immediately, whose Spirit he is. See <hi>John</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. Those therefore who renounce a dependence on him for instruction out of the Word, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left unto palpable <hi>Ignorance</hi> about these things, or unto <hi>foolish corrupt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> concerning them. Hence some of them openly deny, some faintly grant, but evidently corrupt the Truth, concerning
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:200371:54"/> the person of Christ; and as unto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Grace, they seem to have little regard. And what else can be expected from such who despise the <hi>Teaching of that Spirit</hi> of Christ, who is promised to lead us into all Truth concerning him. Nor will the loudest pretences of some unto <hi>the Spirit</hi> in this matter relieve them. For we enquire not after <hi>every spirit,</hi> that any one who will, may make his boast of, but of that Spirlt alone which instructs us in and by the written Word. Until such men will return unto the onely Rule and Guide of Christians, until they will own it their duty to seek for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth from the Scripture alone, and in their so doing depend not on any thing in themselves, but the saving instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Spirit of God, it is in vain to contend with them. For they and we build on divers foundations, and their faith and ours are resolved into divers principles; ours into the Scripture, theirs into a light of their own. There are therefore no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acknowledged <hi>principles</hi> between us, whereon we may convince each other. And this is the cause that disputes with such persons are generally fruitless, especially as immixed with that intemperancy of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:200371:55"/> other men, wherein they exceed. For if that be a way either of learning or teaching of the Truth, it is what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath not instructed us in. When the <hi>Vail</hi> shall be taken from their eyes, and they turned unto the Lord, they will learn more modesty and humility. In the mean time the issue between these men and us, is this and no other. We perswade men to take the Scripture as the <hi>only Rule,</hi> and the holy promised Spirit of God sought by ardent prayers and supplications in the use of all means appointed by Christ for that end, <hi>for their Guide.</hi> They deal with men to turn into themselves, and to attend unto the Light within them: Whilst we build on these most distant principles, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between us is irreconcilable, and will be eternal. Could we come to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, other things would fall away of themselves If we shall <hi>renounce the Scripture,</hi> and the instruction given out of it unto the Church by the Spirit of God, betaking our selves unto <hi>our own Light,</hi> we are sure it will teach us nothing, but either what they profess or other things altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as corrupt. And if they on the other hand, will forgo their attendance to their pretended Light, to hearken unto <hi>the voice</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:200371:55"/>
                  <hi>of God in the Scripture</hi> only, and to beg sincerely the guidance of the Holy Spirit therein, they will learn from thence no other thing but what we profess. Until therefore they return unto <hi>the Law and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> without which whatsoever is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, there is no <hi>Light</hi> in any, we have no more to do, but labouring to preserve the flock of Christ in the profession of the <hi>Truth once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the difference between the <hi>Word and Spirit</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> on the other, unto the Decision of Jesus Christ at the last day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is from no other Root that the contempt of the mysteries of the Gospel, and the preferring of other doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, is sprung up into so much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit among us. It is by the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</hi> alone, that our minds are enlightened to know what is the hope of God's Calling, and what are the Riches of his glorious grace. What is his Work herein upon our minds, &amp; what upon the Word it self, shall be afterwards declared. At present, from what hath been proved it is sufficiently evident, that without his especial gracious aid and assistance, no man can discern, like or approve of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:200371:56"/> of the Gospel. And is it any wonder if persons who avowedly deny most of his <hi>blessed operations,</hi> should be either unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, or dislike those <hi>mysteries,</hi> so as to prefer that which is more suited unto their natural understanding and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son above them? For why should men esteem of those things which they do not understand, at least as they ought, nor will make use of the means whereby they may be enabled so to do? Wherefore if there be persons of such a pride and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, as to undertake an enquiry into the Scriptures, to know the Mind of God in them, and to teach it unto others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayers and supplications for the teaching, leading, guidance and assistance of the Holy Spirit, or which is worse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and despise all those things as <hi>Euthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,</hi> it may not be expected that they should ever understand, or approve of the mysteries that are contained therein. Is it not hence that both Teachers and Hearers make so <hi>slow a progress</hi> in the knowledge of the mysteries of the Gospel, or grow so little in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ? How many are there amongst us who for the time, and outward means are become as <hi>babes,</hi> and have need
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:200371:56"/> of <hi>Milk,</hi> and not of strong meat? Whence is it that so many Teachers do so little endeavour <hi>to go on to perfection,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves to dwell on the rudiments or <hi>first principles</hi> of our profession? Is there not great studying, and little profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? great teaching, and little learning, much hearing, and little thriving? Do we abide in prayer, and abound in prayer, as we ought for that Spirit who <hi>alone can lead us into all Truth?</hi> for that <hi>unction which teacheth us all things</hi> with Assurance and Experience. I fear here lieth our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. However this I shall say, that there is no duty, which in this world we perform unto God, that is more acceptable unto him, then <hi>fervent prayers,</hi> for a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of his Mind and Will in his Word. For herein all the glory we give unto him, and the due performance of all our obedience do depend.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The especial work of the holy Spirit in the Illumination of our Minds unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Scripture, declared and vindicated. Objections proposed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. The Nature of the Work asserted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 25. <hi>Joh</hi> 5. 20. opened and vindicated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have as I suppose sufficiently confirmed our first general Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning <hi>the Necessity of an especial Work of the Holy Ghost, in the Illumination of our minds, to make us understand the Mind of God as revealed in the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we proceed unto is to shew the <hi>Especial Nature</hi> of his work herein. And I shall take occasion thereunto from the consideration of an Objection that is laid against the whole of what we affirm, which was touched on before.</p>
               <p>For it is said that there is no Need of this Endeavour: <hi>All men do acknowledge that the Aid of the Spirit of God is necessary unto the study and Interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And so it is unto all other undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:200371:57"/>
                  <hi>that are good and lawful. And herein consists the blessing of God upon mans own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and endeavours. If this be that which is intended, namely, the blessing of God upon our endeavours in the use of means, it is granted. But if any thing else be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, it is nothing, but to take off all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry in the use of means, to reject all helps of reason and learning, which is in the end to reduce into perfect Enthusiasms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Whether by the Assignation of his <hi>own Work</hi> unto the Spirit of God we take away or weaken the use of <hi>other Means</hi> for the right interpretation of the Scriptures will be tryed when we come unto the examination of those waies and means. At present I shall only say, that we establish them. For by assigning unto them their proper place and use, we do manifest their Work and Necessity. But those by whom they or any of them are advanced into the place, and unto the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> of the operation of the Holy Spirit, do destroy them, or render them inaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, and useless unto the souls of men. We shall therefore manifest that the <hi>Assignations</hi> which we make in this matter unto the Holy Spirit, do render all our use of proper means for the right <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:200371:58"/>
                  <hi>of the Scripture</hi> in a way of duty, indispensibly necessary; and the principal reason, so far as I can understand, why some deny the Necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit herein, is because they like not those means whose necessary use doth arise from an admission thereof.</p>
               <p>But thus it hath fallen out in other things. Those who have declared any thing either of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or of the <hi>Power</hi> of the grace of the Gospel, have been traduced as opposing the principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Reason, whereas on their grounds alone, their true value can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and their proper use directed. So the Apostle Preaching Faith in Christ with Righteousness, and Justification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was accused to have made void the Law, whereas without his Doctrine the Law would have been void, or of no use to the souls of men. So he pleads, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid, yea we establish the Law.</hi> So to this day, Justification by the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, and the Necessity of our own obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the Efficacy of Divine grace in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and the liberty of our own wills, the Stability of God's Promises, and our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:200371:58"/> diligent use of means are supposed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent. So it is here also. The Necessity of the communication of spiritual light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our minds to enable us to understand the Scriptures, and the exercise of our own Reason in the use of external means, are look'd on as irreconcilable. But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>Do we make void the Law by Faith? yea we establish it;</hi> though he did it not in that place, nor unto those ends that the <hi>Jews</hi> would have had and used it. So we may say, do we by asserting the Righteousness of Christ, make void our own obedience; by the Efficacy of grace, destroy the liberty of our wills; by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Spiritual Illumination, take away the use of Reason? yea we establish them: We do it not, it may be, in such a way, or in such a manner as some would fancy, and which would render them all on our part really useless, but in a clear consistency with, and proper subserviency unto the work of God's Spirit and grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in particular which lieth before us, is to remove that pretence of some, <hi>that we need no other Assistance of the Spirit of God for the right understanding of the Scripture, but only his blessing in general on our own endeavours.</hi> To this end two things
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:200371:59"/> are to inquired into, (1.) What Description is given of this <hi>Work</hi> in the Scripture, and what are the Effects of it in our minds in <hi>general.</hi> (2.) What is the <hi>Nature of it in particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Work it self is variously expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Scripture. And it is that which whether we will or no, we must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by in things of this kind. And the variety of expression serves both unto the confirmation of its Truth, and illustration of its Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is declared by <hi>opening of our Eyes, Psal.</hi> 119. 18. <hi>The inlightening of the eyes of our understanding, Ephes.</hi> 1. 18. This <hi>opening of our Eyes</hi> consists in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of spiritual light unto our minds by the Preaching of the Word, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. And the expression though in part <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> is eminently instructive in the Nature of this Work. For suppose the nearest and best disposed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of any object unto our bodily eyes, with an external light properly suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the discovery of it, yet if our <hi>Eyes be blind,</hi> or are closed beyond our own power to <hi>open</hi> them, we cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it aright. Wherefore on a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the proposal unto our minds of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:200371:59"/> Divine Truths of supernatural Revelation, and that in waies and by means suited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the coveyance of it unto them, which is done in the Scripture, and by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Church with other outward means; yet without this Work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, called the <hi>opening of our Eyes,</hi> we cannot discern it in a due manner. And if this be not intended in this expression, it is no way <hi>instructive,</hi> but rather suited to lead us into a misunderstanding of what is declared, and of our own duty. So it is plainly expressed, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25. <hi>Then opened he their understanding, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures.</hi> None I suppose will deny but that it is the Work of the Spirit of God thus <hi>to open our Eyes,</hi> or to <hi>inlighten our Ʋnderstandings,</hi> for this were to deny the express Testimony of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and those frequently reiterated. But some say, he doth this by the <hi>Word</hi> only, and the Preaching of it. No other Work of his, they affirm, is necessary hereunto, or to make us rightly to discern the Mind of God in the Scripture, but that it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto us in a due manner, provided we purge our minds from prejudices, and corrupt affections. And this is the Work of the Spirit in that he is the <hi>Author of the</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:200371:60"/>
                  <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he makes use of for our Illumination. And it is granted, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the only external means of our Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But in these Testimonies it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered only as the Object thereof. They express a work of the Spirit or Grace of God <hi>upon our minds,</hi> with respect unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as its object, <hi>Open my Eyes that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold wondrous things out of thy Law.</hi> The Law or the Scripture, with the wonderful things contained therein, are the <hi>things to be known,</hi> to be discovered and understood. But the means inabling us thereunto, is an <hi>internal Work</hi> upon our minds themselves, which is plainly expressed in distinction from the <hi>things to be known.</hi> This is the summe of what we plead, there is an Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Work of the Spirit of God, opening our Eyes, or inlightening our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Minds, to understand the things contained in the Scripture distinct from the objective propositions of them in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it self, which the Testimonies urged do fully confirm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is expressed, as a <hi>Translation out of darkness into light,</hi> he hath called us out of <hi>darkness into marvelous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Delivered us from the power of darkness, Col.</hi> 1. 13. whereby we who were <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:200371:60"/>
                  <hi>became light in the Lord, Ephes.</hi> 5. 8. That in these and the like Testimonies, the removal of the inward darkness of our minds, by the communication of spiritual light unto them, and not meerly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelation of Truth in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is intended, I have proved at large elsewhere, and therefore shall not again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist thereon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is directly called, <hi>the giving of us an understanding; we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we may know him that is true,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. The object of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that which we know, is <hi>he that is True.</hi> God himself even the Father is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intended in this expression; for in the following words there is mention of his <hi>Son Jesus Christ,</hi> who is in like manner said to be <hi>True,</hi> because of his Unity in Essence with the Father. And therefore it is added, <hi>That this is the True God, v.</hi> 21.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:200371:61"/> Natural and Essential faculty of our souls, that is here intended; for although our Natures are corrupted by sin, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired but by Jesus Christ; yet doth not that corruption nor reparation denote the <hi>destroying</hi> or New <hi>Creation</hi> of this being, or the Nature of those faculties, which continue the same in both Estates: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Understanding here mentioned is no more <hi>but a power and ability of Mind with respect unto what is proposed unto us,</hi> to receive and apprehend it in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; we are not able of our selves <hi>to know him that is True, and the Eternal Life that is in him,</hi> but he hath enabled us thereunto; for this <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> is <hi>given</hi> us unto that end, that we may so know him. Wherefore whatever is proposed unto us in the Gospel, or in any Divine Revelation, concerning these things, we cannot <hi>know them,</hi> at least as we ought, unless we have the <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> here mentioned given unto us, for so alone do we come by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>given</hi> us, that a real and <hi>Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Communication</hi> unto us of the thing said to be <hi>given,</hi> is intended in this word, of giving from God, is evident from every place in the Scripture where it is used. Some contend that God is said to <hi>give</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:200371:62"/>
                  <hi>things</hi> unto us, when <hi>he doth what lyes in him</hi> that we may enjoy them, though we are never made partakers of them. But the assignation of this way and manner of <hi>God's doing what lieth in him,</hi> where the Effect designed doth not ensue, not strictly restrained unto outward means, is scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and fit to be exploded out of Christian <hi>Theologie.</hi> God saies, <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done? Isa.</hi> 5. 4. But the expression hath plainly a double limitation, (1.) Unto the <hi>Ʋse of outward Means</hi> only, concerning which God speaks in that place, and from which he elsewhere plainly distinguisheth his <hi>giving them a new heart,</hi> and a <hi>new spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that they shall all know him, and be all taught of him. (2.) Unto the <hi>Ʋse of those outward Means</hi> that were <hi>then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,</hi> as the only way for the season; for even in respect unto them he did more <hi>for his Vineyard</hi> when he granted the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto it. But is it possible that any man should think or believe that God cannot really <hi>collate grace</hi> and mercy on the souls of men when he pleaseth? Is it not as easy with him, on our Restauration by Christ, to implant <hi>habits of grace</hi> on our souls, as it was at first to create us in <hi>Original</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:200371:62"/>
                  <hi>Rectitude</hi> and Righteousness? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we may enquire what God <hi>doth,</hi> and <hi>hath done</hi> in this matter accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath revealed it in his word, yet to say that he doth in any thing, <hi>what lieth in him,</hi> though the things which he affirms himself to do, be not effected, is defective both in Truth and Piety. When he saith he hath done such a thing, or will do so; for us to say, No he hath not done so, or he will not do so, but he hath done, or will do what lies in him that it may be so, though it never be so, nor have so been is to make him altogether like our selves. But on this ground some pretend that <hi>the Son of God is said to have given men Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> because he hath done what is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite on his part</hi> in the Declaration of the Gospel, that we may have it, whether ever we have it or no. But (1.) what he is said to <hi>have done,</hi> he had at least a design to do, and if he had so, why doth it not take effect? It is, they say, because of the <hi>unwillingness of men to turn unto him,</hi> and other <hi>vicious habits</hi> of their minds, which hinders them from receiving instruction. But if it be so, then (1.) It is supposed that men also in their teachings can <hi>give us an Ʋnderstanding,</hi> as well as the Son of God;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:200371:63"/> for they may teach men the knowledge of the Gospel, if they are <hi>willing to learn,</hi> and have no darling lusts or <hi>vicious habits</hi> of mind to hinder them from learning. (2.) Seeing he hath taken this work on himself, and designs its accomplishments, cannot the <hi>Son of God by his grace</hi> remove those <hi>vicious habits</hi> of the minds of men, that they may have an understanding of these things? If he <hi>cannot,</hi> why doth he take that on him which he cannot effect? If he <hi>will not,</hi> why doth he promise to do that which can never be done, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what he will not do? and why is he said to do, (as he is according to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words) which he hath not done, which he will not or cannot do. (2.) The giving of <hi>an Ʋnderstanding</hi> is in this place plainly distinguished from the <hi>proposition of the things to be understood;</hi> that consists in the Doctrine of the Gospel, this in an ability to comprehend and know it.</p>
               <p>Again, the words here used, of <hi>giving Ʋnderstanding,</hi> may indeed express the actings or operations of men towards others, when an external proposal of things to be understood, with the due use of means, is intended. But yet if under their <hi>teaching</hi> men do not <hi>learn</hi> or comprehend
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:200371:63"/> the things wherein they are instructed by them, they cannot properly be said to have <hi>given them an understanding of it</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto their moral operation unto that End, but only to have <hi>Endeavoured</hi> so to do. But when this Phraise of speech is used to express <hi>a Divine</hi> operation, which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless may be really <hi>Physical,</hi> and so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Efficacious to Interpret it concerning an <hi>Endeavour</hi> that may, or may not succeed, is not suitable unto those thoughts that become us concerning Divine Operation. Now was there any Reason why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle should <hi>Emphatically</hi> assigne this work, unto the Son of God, and that as he is the true God and Eternal Life; if no more be intended but a work of the same nature and kind, with what a man might do. And if this be the sense of the Words; it is from <hi>our selves</hi> and not from the <hi>son of God,</hi> that there is any Truth in them, as unto the Event. For he might do it seems, what lies in him to <hi>give an understanding;</hi> and yet no one man in the world ever had an understanding of the Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed; for if it may be so with <hi>any</hi> unto whom he is said to give an understanding, as it is professedly with the most; it may be so with <hi>all:</hi> not further to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:200371:64"/> debate these things at present, whereas so excellent a grace and Mercy towards the Souls of Men, is here expressedly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Son of God, as the Author of it; Namely, that <hi>he gives us an Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that we may know him, which is true;</hi> I cannot think, that they Interpret the Scripture unto his Glory, whose Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this place consists in nothing but endeavours to prove that indeed <hi>he doth not so do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is Expressed by <hi>teaching, leading,</hi> and <hi>guiding into the Truth,</hi> Joh. 6. 45. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 13. 1 Joh. 2. 20, 27. the places have been opened before; and two things are supposed in this Expression of <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 1. <hi>A mind capable of Instruction, Leading and Conduct:</hi> the nature must be <hi>rational</hi> and comprehensive of the means of Instruction, which can be so <hi>taught.</hi> Wherefore we do not only grant herein the use of the rational Faculties of the Soul, but require their <hi>Exercise</hi> and utmost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement: If God <hi>Teacheth</hi> we are to <hi>learn,</hi> and we cannot learn but in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our Minds. And it is in vain pretended, that God's Communication of a Supernatural Ability unto our Minds, and our exercise of them in a way of Duty,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:200371:64"/> are <hi>Inconsistent;</hi> Whereas indeed they are <hi>inseparable</hi> in all that we are taught of God. For at the same time that he <hi>Infus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a gracious Ability</hi> into our minds, he proposeth the Truth unto us, whereon that Ability is to be Exercised. And if those things are Inconsistent, the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Efficacy of God in the Souls of Men, must be denied; which is to dispoile him of his Soveraignty; But we speak now of Natural Abilit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>an Immediate Infallible▪ Inspiration and afflatus,</hi> of the same Nature with that of the Prophets and Apostles of old. But (1) This takes away the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Ordinary</hi> gifts of the Spirit so fully Asserted in the Scripture, as we shall elsewhere declare. And if it were so, God did not place in the Church <hi>some Prophets,</hi> seeing all were so, and were alwaies to be so. (2) It brings in a Neglect of the Scripture, and a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:200371:65"/> levelling it into the same state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the conceptions of every one that will pretend unto this <hi>Inspiration.</hi> (3.) The pretence visibly confutes it self, in the manifold mutual contradictions of them that pretend unto it. And would (4.) Thereon be a principle first of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then of infidelity, and so lead unto Atheism. (5.) The <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves had not the knowledge and understanding of the mind and will of God which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after by their <hi>Immediate Inspiration,</hi> which were unto them as the written word unto us; but had it by the same means as we have, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. Hence they so frequently and fervently <hi>prayed for Ʋnderstanding,</hi> as we have seen in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore (2.) Some say this <hi>Teaching</hi> consists only in the outward Preaching of the Word, in the Ministry of the Church, and other external means of its applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto our minds. But there is not one of the Testimonies insisted on, where in this promised <hi>Teaching of God,</hi> is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the proposition of the word in the outward dispensation of it, as hath been proved. Besides, every one that enjoyes this Teaching, that is, who is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:200371:65"/> taught of God, doth really believe and come to Christ thereby. <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God, every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour. But it is not thus with all, nor ever was, towards whom the most powerful and cogent means of outward Instruction have been or are used.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (3.) This Teaching is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal work of the spirit,</hi> giving Light, Wisdom, Understanding unto our minds, so is spoken of, and promised in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner distinct from the outward work of the dispensation of the Word, and all the Efficacy of it singly considered. One Testimony will serve to this purpose which hath been pleaded and vindicated already▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But the Unction consists in a real Communication of Supernatural gifts and graces; whereof <hi>Supernatural light</hi> is that which is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly necessary unto this end. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of them all, in all fulness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jesus Christ the head of the Church was his <hi>Ʋnction, Heb.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the real participation of them in our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:200371:66"/> Measure doth our Unction whereby we are taught consist.</p>
               <p>It is granted that this teaching is such as <hi>regards our own Industry</hi> in the use of means Appointed unto this end, that we may know the mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But yet it is such as includes an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Effectual Operation</hi> of the Holy Spirit concomitant with the outward means of Teaching and Learning. When the <hi>Eunuch</hi> read the <hi>Prophecy of Isaiah,</hi> he affirmed he <hi>could not understand it</hi> unless some one did <hi>guide</hi> him. Hereon <hi>Philip</hi> opened the Scripture unto him; but it was the Holy Ghost that opened his Heart, that he might understand it; for so he did <hi>the heart of Lydia,</hi> without which she would not have understood the Preaching of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 16. 14. Wherefore in our learning, under the conduct or Teaching of the Spirit, the utmost diligence in the exercise of our own minds is required of us. And where men are defective herein, they are said to be <gap reason="foreign">

And it is a sensless thing to imagine that men should be diverted from the exercise of the faculties of their minds, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:200371:66"/> they are enabled to use them unto good purpose, or successfully, which is the Effect of this Internal Teaching.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is expressed <hi>by shining into our hearts. God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts; to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Jesus Christ is the <hi>Image of the Invisible God, the brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his person.</hi> And that because of the illustrious representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Divine Excellencies, that are made both in his person and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. The person of the Father is the Eternal Fountain of infinitely Divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections; and they are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto the Son by Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In his person <hi>absolutely</hi> as the Son of God, they are all of them <hi>Essentially;</hi> in his person as God Man, as vested with his Offices, they are <hi>substantially</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all types and shadows; and in the glass of the Gospel they are <hi>accidentally</hi> by Revelation; <hi>really,</hi> but not <hi>substantially,</hi> for Christ himself is the body, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all. As the <hi>Image of God,</hi> so is he represented unto us in the glass of the Gospel, and therein are we called <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:200371:67"/>
                  <hi>the glory of God</hi> in him, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 18. The meaning is, that the Truth and Doctrine concerning Jesus Christ his Person and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, is so delivered and taught in the Gospel, as that the Glory of God is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently represented thereby, or therein is revealed what we are to know of God, his Mind and his Will as he is declared by and in Jesus Christ. But why is it then that all do not thus <hi>behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</hi> unto whom the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is Preached? or whence is it that all unto whom the Gospel is Preached or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared do not apprehend and understand the truth and reality, and glory of the things revealed or proposed? that is, why they do not understand the Mind and Will of God as revealed in the Gospel? The Apostle assigneth two reasons hereof, (1.) From what <hi>hindereth it in many;</hi> (2.) From what is <hi>necessary unto any</hi> that so they may do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is the <hi>Efficacy of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and suggestions of Satan,</hi> whereby their minds are filled with prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel and the Doctrine of it, being blinded hereby, they can see nothing of beauty and glory in it, and so certainly do not apprehend it aright. <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>The God</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:200371:67"/>
                  <hi>of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel of Christ who is the Image of God should shine into them.</hi> This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all to be an obstacle against the right understanding of the Gospel. Unless the mind be freed from such <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> as are the Effects of such <hi>blinding Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy</hi> of the suggestions of Satan, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain unto the true knowledge of the Mind of God therein. How these preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices are removed we shall shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But if the mind be free, or freed from them, then it is supposed by some, that there is need of no more but the due exercise of its faculties with diligence for that end, nor is any thing else required thereunto. It is true, in the ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of Divine Grace this is required of us. But the Apostle adds,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there must moreover be a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light shining into our hearts,</hi> to enable us hereunto. At least he doth so that this was granted unto them who <hi>then did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> And if we have it not, as well as they, I fear we do not believe in the same manner as they did. Wherefore although there be in the Gospel, and the Doctrine of it, an illustrious representation of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:200371:68"/> Glory of God in Christ; yet are we not able of our selves to discern it, until the holy Spirit by an Act of his Almighty Power do <hi>irradiate</hi> our minds, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant a light upon them suited thereunto. He that doth not <hi>behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ in the Gospel,</hi> doth not understand the Mind and Will of God as revealed therein, in a due manner. I suppose this will be granted, seeing both these things are but one and the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly expressed. But this of our selves we cannot do. For there is an internal work of God upon our minds necessary thereunto. This also is expressed in the words. It is his <hi>shining into our hearts to give the Light of this Knowledge unto us;</hi> There is a Light in the Gospel; <hi>the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, ver.</hi> 4. But there must be a <hi>Light also in our Hearts,</hi> or we cannot discern it. And this is no natural Light, or a Light that is common unto all; but it is a Light that in a way of grace is given unto them that do believe. And it is wrought in us by the same kind of Efficiency, as God <hi>created Light</hi> at the beginning of the world; namely, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive Act of Power. It is evident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the <hi>Light in our Hearts,</hi> which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:200371:68"/> God communicates unto us, that we may have the true Knowledge of his Mind and Will in the Gospel, is distinct from that <hi>Light of Truth</hi> which is in the Gospel it self. The one is <hi>Subjective,</hi> the other is <hi>Objective</hi> only; the one is wrought in us, the other is proposed unto us; the one is an Act of Divine Power in us, the other an Act of Divine Grace and Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
               <p>Other waies there are whereby this Operation of the Holy Spirit in the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our minds is expressed. The Instances given, and Testimonies consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are sufficient unto our purpose. That which we are in the proof of is, that there is more required unto an useful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp; understanding of the Mind of God in the Scripture, then the meer <hi>Objective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal</hi> of it unto us, and our diligent use of outward means to come to the knowledge of it; which yet as we shall shew is from the Holy Spirit also. And as the denial hereof doth by just consequence make void the <hi>Principal Means</hi> whereby we may come unto such an understanding, namely, frequent and fervent prayers for the aid and assistance of the Holy Spirit; so no tolerable account can be given of the Mind
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200371:69"/> of God, and the meaning of the Scripture in the places insisted on. And certainly we cannot understand the way and manner of the operation of the Holy Spirit herein, it were much better to <hi>captivate our Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding unto the obedience of Truth,</hi> then to wrest and pervert the Scripture, or debase the spiritual sense of it unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with our conceptions and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions▪ But as we have herein the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of them that do believe, in their own experience, who both value and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this grace and priviledge unto the Glory of God; so we have multiplied In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of such as being destitute of that skill which should enable them to make use of sundry external means which are in their proper place of great advantage, who yet by vertue of this <hi>Divine Teaching</hi> are wise in the things of God, beyond what some others with all their skill, can attain unto.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Effect</hi> of this Work of the Holy Spirit on the minds of men, doth evidence of what nature it is. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is variously expressed. As,</p>

Mat.</hi> 6. 23. And because men are subject to mistake herein, and to suppose themselves with the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to see, when they are blind, he gives that caution, <hi>Take heed therefore that the Light which is in thee be not darkness, Luke</hi> 11. 35. For men are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to please themselves with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improvement of their natural Light, which yet in the issue with respect unto spiritual things, will prove but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And while they are under the power of this darkness, that is, while their minds are deeply affected with their natural igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they <hi>cannot perceive spiritual things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. no not when they are most evidently proposed unto them. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>the Light shine in darkness,</hi> or cast out its beams in the evidence and glory of spiritual Truth, yet <hi>the darkness compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth it not, John</hi> 1. 5. But by this work of the Holy. Spirit we are made <hi>Light in the Lord.</hi> Light in the mind is a spiritual
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:200371:70"/> ability to discern and know spiritual things, as is declared, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. This is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, and communicated unto us by the Holy Spirit. There is a real difference between Light and Darkness. And it is our minds that are affected with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 35. The removal of the one, and the introduction of the other, are things not absolutely in our own power: He who is Darkness, cannot make himself Light in the Lord. Whatever he may do in way of disposition or preparation, in way of duty and diligence, in the utmost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the natural faculties of his mind, (which no man will ever rise unto who is under the power of this Darkness, because of the insuperable prejudices, and corrupt affections that it fills the mind withall) yet the <hi>introduction of this Light</hi> is an Act of him who openeth the eyes of our understandings, and shines into our Hearts. Without this <hi>Light</hi> no man can understand the Scripture as he ought; and I shall not contend about what they see or behold who are in darkness.</p>
               <p>The expulsion of <hi>Spiritual Darkness</hi> out of our minds, and the introduction of <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> into them, a work so great, that they who were <hi>Darkness,</hi> whose <hi>Light</hi>

                  <hi>was Darkness,</hi> are made <hi>Light</hi> in the Lord thereby, is an Effect of the immediate Power of the Spirit of God. To ascribe other low and <hi>metaphorical</hi> senses unto the words, is to corrupt the Scripture, and to deny the Testimony of God. For this <hi>Light</hi> he produceth in us by the same Power, and the same manner of operation, whereby he brought Light out of Darkness at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all things. But by this way and means it is, that we attain the knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ, or the Revelation of his Mind and Will in the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is called <hi>Ʋnderstanding.</hi> So the Psalmist prayes, <hi>Give me understanding and I shall keep thy Law, Psal.</hi> 119. 34. So the Apostle speaks to <hi>Timothy; Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 7. Besides his own <hi>consideration</hi> of what was proposed unto him, which includes the due and diligent use of all outward means: It was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over necessary that <hi>God should give him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> by an inward effectual work of his Spirit, that he might comprehend the things wherein he was instructed. And the desire hereof, as of that without which there can be no saving knowledge of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:200371:71"/> Word, nor advantage by it, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresseth <hi>emphatically</hi> with great fervency of spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 144. <hi>The Righteousness of thy Testimonies is everlasting. O give me understanding and I shall live.</hi> Without this he knew that he could have no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Everlasting Righteousness of the Testimonies of God. All understanding indeed, however it be abused by the most, is the work and effect of the Holy Ghost. For the <hi>Inspiration of the Almighty giveth Ʋnderstanding, Job</hi> 32. 8. So is this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Understanding in an especial manner. And in this Understanding both the ability of our minds, and the due exercise of it is included. And this one consideration that the Saints of God have with so much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness prayed that God would <hi>give them Ʋnderstanding in his Mind and Will,</hi> as revealed in the Word, with his reiterated Promises that he would so do, is of more weight with me, then all the disputes of men to the contrary. And there is no further Argument necessary to prove that men do not understand the Mind of God in the Scripture in a due manner, then their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal and confidence that so they can do, without the communication of a <hi>Spiritual Ʋnderstanding</hi> unto them by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:200371:71"/> of God; which is so contrary unto the plain express Testimonies thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is called <hi>Wisdom.</hi> For by this work on the minds of men they are rendred <hi>Wise</hi> unto salvation. So the Apostle prays for the <hi>Colossians, That God would fill them with the knowledge of his Will in all Wisdom and Spiritual Ʋnderstanding, chap.</hi> 1. 9. These things may be the same, and the latter <hi>Exegetical</hi> of the former. If there be a difference, <hi>Wisdom</hi> respects things in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in their whole <hi>systeme</hi> and <hi>complex; Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> respects particulars as they are to be reduced unto practice. Wherefore the Spiritual Understanding which the Apostle prays for, respects the Mind of God in especial or particular places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and Wisdom is a skill and ability in the comprehension of the whole systeme of his counsel, as revealed therein. He who is thus <hi>made wise,</hi> and he alone can <hi>understand</hi> the things of God as he ought, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 45. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men may bear themselves high on their Learning, their natural abilities, their fruitful inventions, tenacious memories, various fancies, plausibility of expression, with long study and endeavours, things good and praise-worthy in their kind and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:200371:72"/> order; yet unless they are thus <hi>made wise</hi> by the Spirit of God, they will scarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a due acquaintance with his Mind and Will. For this effect of that work is also expresly called <hi>Knowledge, Col.</hi> 1. 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. Wherefore without it we cannot have that which is properly so called.</p>
               <p>This is the second thing designed in this Discourse. In the first it was proved in general, that there is an <hi>Effectual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God on the minds of men,</hi> enabling them to perceive and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the supernatural Revelations of the Scripture when proposed unto them. And in the second is declared, what is the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that work,</hi> and what are the effects of it on our minds. Both of them have I treated meerly from Scripture Testimony. For in vain shall we seek to any other way or means for what we ought to apprehend and believe herein. Neither is the force of these Testimonies to be eluded by any distinctions or <hi>evasions</hi> whatever. Nor whilst the Authority of the Scripture is allowed, can any men more effectually evidence the weakness and depravation of their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> then by contending that in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it; they can understand the Mind
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:200371:72"/> and Will of God, as revealed therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the especial Aid and Illumination of the Spirit of God Nor can any man on that supposition with any wisdom or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency in his own principles, make use in a way of duty of the Principal means whereby we may so understand them, as will afterwards more fully appear.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Causes of the Ignorance of the Mind of God revealed in the Scripture; and of Errours about it; what they are; and how they are removed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Supposition we proceed upon in this Discourse is, that <hi>God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Mind and Will unto us, as unto all things concerning his Worship, with our Faith and Obedience therein, in the Holy Scripture.</hi> Thereon do we enquire by what means we may attain the <hi>saving Knowledge</hi> of the Mind of God so revealed. And my principal design is to shew, what <hi>Aid and Assistance</hi> we receive from the Holy Ghost unto that End. To further us in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:200371:73"/> hereof, I shall enquire into the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Reasons of that Ignorance,</hi> and those misapprehensions of the Mind of God as revealed, which are amongst men, and how our minds are delivered from them.</p>
               <p>It may be this part of our Discourse might have had a more proper place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto it, after we have given the Truth pleaded a more full confirmation. But whereas an Objection may arise from the consideration of what we shall now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on, against the Truth contended for; I thought it not amiss so to obviate it, as therewithall farther to illustrate the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self, which we labour in.</p>
               <p>All men see, and most men complain of that ignorance of the Mind of God, and those abominable Errours attended with false Worship which abound in the world. How few are there who understand and believe the Truth aright? What <hi>divisions,</hi> what <hi>scandals,</hi> what <hi>animosities,</hi> what <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> mutual rage and persecutions, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue hereon, among them that are called Christians, is likewise known. Hence some take occasion to countenance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in an open declension unto <hi>Atheism,</hi> some unto a great <hi>indifferency</hi> in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, some to advance themselves and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:200371:73"/> destroy others, by the advantage of their Opinions, according as they are prevalent in some times and places. A brief Enquiry into the Causes of that <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> which is in the world amongst men outwardly owning the Doctrine of the Gospel, and especially of the <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> which do abound above what they have done in most Ages, may be of use to preserve us from those evils. A subject this is, that would require much time and diligence unto the handling of it in a due manner. I intend only at present to point at the <hi>Heads of some few things,</hi> the observation whereof may be of use unto the end designed.</p>
               <p>Those of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> tell us, that the cause hereof is, the <hi>obscurity, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and perplexity of the Scripture.</hi> If men will trust thereunto as their only Guide, they are sure to miscarry. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only relief in this matter is, that we give up our souls unto the <hi>conduct of their Church,</hi> which neither can erre, nor deceive. So indeed said <hi>Adam</hi> of old, when he was charged with his sin and infidelity; <hi>The woman that thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi> But whereas it is an evil, yea the greatest of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:200371:74"/> evils, whose causes we enquire after, it seems in general more rational that we should saek for them in <hi>our selves,</hi> then in any thing that God hath done. For he alone is good and we are evil.</p>
               <p>It is granted that God hath given us his Word, or the holy Scriptures as a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Mind and Will; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath given it unto us for this very end and purpose, that we may know them and do them. But whereas many men do fail herein, and do not understand aright what is revealed, but fall into pernicious errours and mistakes unto his dishonour and their own ruine, is it meet to say unto God, that this comes to pass from hence, because the Revelation he hath made of these things is <hi>dark, obscure and intricate?</hi> or the Scripture which thou hast given us doth deceive us? would a due reverence or deferency unto the Wisdom, Goodness and Love of God unto Mankind be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therein; <hi>Audax omnia perpeti gens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana ruit per vetitum nefas.</hi> What will not the prejudices and corrupt Interests of men carry them out into? God will for ever preserve those that are his, in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of that Religion, be it what it will, that by any means leads unto an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:200371:74"/> of that Revelation of himself, which in infinite Wisdom and Goodness he hath made unto us.</p>
               <p>But is it because there is <hi>no Reason</hi> to be given of this evil from the minds of men themselves, that it is thus ascribed unto God? May not as well all the wickednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that the world is filled withall be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him and what he hath done? Doth not each one see a <hi>sufficient cause</hi> hereof even in himself, if he were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it by the power of the Spirit and grace of God? Do not other men who fail in the right Knowledge of God, especially in any important Truths, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidence in other things, that the root of this matter is in themselves? Alas! how dark are the minds of poor mortals, how full of Pride and Folly? I shall say with some confidence, he who understands not that there is reason enough to charge all the Errours, Ignorance and Confusions in Religion, that are, or ever were in the world, without the least censure of obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, insufficiency or intricacy in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>on the minds of men,</hi> and those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved affections whose prevalency they are obnoxious unto, are themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly ignorant of the state of all things above and here below.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:200371:75"/>
               <p> We must therefore enquire after the Causes and Reasons of these things among our selves, for there only they will be found.</p>
               <p>And these Causes are of two sorts, (1.) <hi>That which is general,</hi> and the spring of all others; (2.) <hi>Those which are particular</hi> that arise and branch themselves from thence.</p>
               <p>The first and general cause of all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, error and misunderstanding of the mind and will of God, as revealed in the scripture, among all sorts of men, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there particular circumstances are, is the <hi>Natural vanity and darkness with which the minds of all men are depraved.</hi> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Depravation of our minds by the fall, and the effects of it, I have fully else where declared. Wherefore I now take it for granted that the minds of all men are naturally prepossessed with this darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vanity, from whence they are not, from whence they cannot be delivered but by the saving illumination of the Spirit and grace of God. But because I have so largely treated of it both in the <hi>discourses of the dispensation of the Spirit.</hi> Book 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. As also in those concerning the <hi>Apostacy of these latter times,</hi> I shall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain insist upon it.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:200371:75"/>
               <p> Two things I shall only observe unto our present purpose, namely (1.) <hi>That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the mind is kept off from discerning the Glory and Beauty of Spiritual heavenly truth,</hi> and from being sensible of its power and efficacy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 5. (2.) That it is by the same means <hi>enclined unto all things that are Vain, Curious, Superstitious, Carnal,</hi> suited unto the interest of Pride, Lust and all manner of corrupt affections. Hence what ever other occasions of error and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition may be given or taken, the ground of their reception, and of all adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto them, is the <hi>uncured vanity and darkness</hi> of the minds of men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is the mire wherein this rush doth grow.</p>
               <p>And the consideration hereof will recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our thoughts concerning those whom we see daily to <hi>wander from the Truth,</hi> or to live in those misapprehensions of the Mind of God which they have imbibed, notwithstanding the clear Revelation of it unto the contrary. Some think it strange that it should be so, and marvel at them: Some are angry with them, and some would persecute and destroy them. We may make a better use of this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for we may learn from it the <hi>sad</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:200371:76"/>
                  <hi>corruption and depravation of our minds in our estate of Apostacy from God.</hi> Here lies the seed and spring of all the sin, evil and disorder which we behold and suffer under in Religious concerns in this world. And if we consider it aright, it will serve</p>
               <p n="1">1. To impress <hi>a due sense of our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon our minds,</hi> that we may be humbled. And in <hi>Humility</hi> alone there is safety. <hi>His soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, Hab.</hi> 2. 4. for he <hi>draws back from God,</hi> and God hath no pleasure in him, as the Apostle expounds those words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. It was in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our nature to adhere sacredly unto the <hi>first Truth,</hi> to discern and abhor every false way: We were created with that <hi>Light of Truth</hi> in our minds, as was every way able to guide us in all that we had to believe or do, with respect unto God, or our own blessedness for ever. But in the room thereof, through our wretched <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy from God,</hi> our mind is become the seat and habitation of all vanity, disorder and confusion. And no way doth this more discover it self then in the readiness and proneness of multitudes to embrace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is crooked, perverse and false in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, notwithstanding the <hi>clear Revelation</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:200371:76"/> that God hath made of the whole Truth concerning it in the Scripture. A due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection hereon may teach us <hi>Humility</hi> and self-abasement. For we are by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath even as others; neither have we any good thing that we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. It is better therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with such thoughts on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then to be filled with <hi>contempt of,</hi> or <hi>wrath against</hi> those whom we see yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under those woful effects of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Apostasie</hi> from God, wherein we were equally involved with them. Yea,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will teach us <hi>Pity and Compassion</hi> towards those whose minds do run out into the spiritual excesses mentioned. The merciful High Priest of the whole Church <hi>hath compassion on the ignorant, and them that wander out of the way, Heb.</hi> 5. 2. and it is conformity unto him in all things, which ought to be our principal design, if we desire to be like unto him in glory. Want hereof is the ruine of Religion, and the true cause of all the troubles that its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is encumbred withall at this day.</p>
               <p>It is true, for the most part there is an interposition of corrupt affections seducing the minds of men from the Truth. With these are they tossed up and down, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:200371:77"/> so driven with the winds of temptations that befall them. But is it <hi>Humanity</hi> to stand on the shoar, and seeing men in a <hi>storm</hi> at Sea wherein they are ready every moment to be cast away, and perish, to <hi>storm</hi> at them our selves, or to shoot them to death, or to cast fire into their vessel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are in danger of being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Yet no otherwise do we deal with them whom we persecute, because they miss the knowledge of the Truth, and it may be raise a worse <hi>storm</hi> in our selves as to our own <hi>morals,</hi> then they suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their <hi>Intellectuals.</hi> Concerning such persons the advice of the Apostle is, <hi>Of some have compassion making a difference, and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, Jude</hi> 22. 23. Some are so given up in their Apostasie, as that they <hi>sin unto death,</hi> with such we are not to concern our selves, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. But it is very rare that we can safely make that judgment concerning any in this world. Sometimes no doubt we may, or this Rule concerning them had never been given. As unto all others, the worst of them, those that <hi>are in the fire,</hi> the frame of our minds acting towards them, are here presented unto us; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of their present state and <hi>fear</hi> of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:200371:77"/> their future ruine, we ought to be possessed with, and acted by. But how few are they who are so framed and minded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, especially such as by their enormous Errours seem to be fallen into the fire of Gods displeasure? Anger, wrath, fury, contempt towards such persons, men think to be their duty; more contrivances there are usually how they may be <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally destroyed,</hi> then how they may be <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally saved.</hi> But such men profess the Truth as it were by chance. They never knew what it is to learn it aright, nor whence the knowledge of it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor were ever under its power or conduct. Our proper work is to <hi>save such persons</hi> what lies in us, <hi>pulling them out of the fire.</hi> Duties of difficulty and danger unto our selves may be required hereunto: It is easier if we had secular power with us to thrust men into <hi>temporal fire</hi> for their errors, then to free them from <hi>eternal fire</hi> by the Truth. But if we were governed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion for their souls, and fear of their ruine, as it is our duty to be, we would not decline any office of love required thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hath God <hi>lead us into the Truth,</hi> hath he kept us from every false way, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we have abundant cause of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:200371:78"/> and fruitfulness. It is a condition more desperate than that of the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Errours, to <hi>hold the Truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness;</hi> and as good not know the Lord Jesus Christ, as to be barren in the knowledge of him. It is not, we see, of <hi>our selves,</hi> that we either know the Truth, or love it, or abide in the profession of it. We have nothing of this kind but what we have received, <hi>Humility</hi> in our selves, <hi>Ʋse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> towards others, and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> unto God, ought to be the effect of this consideration.</p>
               <p>This is the first general cause of mens misapprehension of the Mind and Will of God as revealed in the Scripture. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it self is plain, perspcuous and full of light. <hi>But this Light shineth into Darkness, and the Darkness comprehendeth it not.</hi> The natural Darkness and Blindness which is in the minds of men, with the vanity and instability which they are attended with, causeth them to wrest the Scriptures unto their own destruction. And for this sort of men to complain, as they do hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> of the obscurity of the Scripture, is all one as if a company of blind men should cry out of an <hi>Eclipse of the Sun,</hi> when he shineth in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:200371:78"/> his full strength and glory. How this Darkness is removed and taken away by the Effectual Operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our Illumination, I have elsewhere at large discoursed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Corrupt Affections</hi> prevalent in the minds of men do hinder them from a right understanding of the Mind of God in the Scripture. For hereby are they effectually enclined to wrest and pervert the Truth, or are filled with prejudices against it. This is the <hi>next Cause</hi> of all Ignorance and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, where we must seek for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Causes of them before proposed. The principal Reason why the generality of men attain not a right understanding of the Mind and Will of God in the Scripture, is the <hi>corrupt affections</hi> that are predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their own minds, whereby they are exposed unto all sorts of impressions and seductions from Satan and the Agents for his Kingdom and Interest. So the Apostle tells us, that <hi>unlearned and unstable men do wrest the Scripture unto their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. And another that these <hi>unlearned and unstable persons, are men of corrupt minds,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. that is, such whose minds are peculiarly under the power of perverse and corrupt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:200371:79"/> affections. For these affections are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. The <hi>wills of the mind,</hi> such as carry it with an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous inclination towards their own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and such as render it obstinate and perverse in its adherence thereunto. These are the Root of that <hi>filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness</hi> which must be cast out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can <hi>receive the ingrafted word with meekness, Jam.</hi> 1. 11. Some few of them may be named.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pride or carnal confidence</hi> in our own Wisdom and Ability of mind for all the ends of our Duty towards God, and this in especial of understanding his Mind and Will, either keeps the souls of men under the bondage of Darkness and Ignorance, or precipitates them into foolish apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or pernicious Errours. As spiritual Pride is the worst sort of Pride, so this is the worst degree of Spiritual Pride, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, when men do not acknowledge God in these things as they ought, but lean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own understandings. This is that which ruined the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, that they could not understand the Mind of God in any thing unto their advantage. It is the <hi>Meek,</hi> the <hi>Humble,</hi> the <hi>Lowly in mind,</hi> those that are <hi>like little Children,</hi> that God
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:200371:79"/> hath promised to teach. This is an eternal and unalterable Law of Gods Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whoever will learn his Mind and Will as revealed in the Scripture, must be <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> renouncing all trust and confidence in themselves. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men of another frame do come to know, they know it not according to the Mind of God, nor according to their own Duty, nor unto their Advantage. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Knowledge</hi> they may have, however <hi>conspicuous</hi> it may be made by their natural and <hi>acquired Abilities,</hi> however it may be garnished with a mixture of secular litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whatever contempt it may raise them unto of others, such as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had of the <hi>People,</hi> whom they esteemed <hi>accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed because they knew not the Law,</hi> yet they knew nothing as they ought, nothing unto the glory of God, nothing to the Spiritual Advantage of their own souls; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is their knowledge to be accounted of? Indeed the knowledge of a proud man, is the Throne of Satan in his mind: To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that persons under the predominancy of Pride, self conceit and self-confidence, can understand the Mind of God as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in a due manner, is to renounce the Scripture or innumerable positive Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:200371:80"/> given in them unto the contrary▪ such Persons cannot make use of any one means of Spiritual Knowledge that God requires of them in a way of Duty, nor improve any one Truth which they may know unto their Good. Therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells the proud <hi>Pharisees,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their skill in the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Tittles</hi> of the Scripture, <hi>That they had not heard the voice of God at any time, nor seen his shape, neither had they his Word abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them,</hi> Joh. 5. 37, 38. They had no right knowledge of him, as he had revealed and declared himself.</p>
               <p>Men infected with this <hi>Leaven</hi> having their Minds tainted with it, have been the great corrupters of Divine Truth, in all Ages. Such have been the Ringleaders of all <hi>Heresies,</hi> and such were they, who have turned the Knowledge of the Will of God proposed in the Scripture, into a <hi>wrangling science</hi> filled with niceties, subtilties, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities, <hi>futilous termes of Art,</hi> and other fuel for the minds of fiery contenders in wrangling disputations.</p>
               <p>And this kind of <hi>self-confidence</hi> is apt to befall all sorts of Men. Those of the meanest capacity may be infected with it, no less then the wisest or most learned,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:200371:80"/> And we frequently see Persons, whose weakness in all sound knowledge, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency for the use of proper means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the attaining of it, might seem to call them unto <hi>Humility and lowliness of Mind</hi> in an eminent manner, yet lifted up unto such a degree of <hi>Spiritual Pride</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own Understandings, as to render them useless, troublesome, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive unto men of sober Minds. But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, are they exposed hereunto, who either really, or in their own apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are <hi>exalted above others</hi> in secular Learning, and natural or acquired Abilities. For such men are apt to think that they must needs know the meaning of the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures better then others, or at least, that they can do so, if they will but set themselves about it. But that which principally hinders them from so doing, is their conceit that so they do. They mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake that for divine Knowledge which is in them the great <hi>obstruction</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Love of Honour and Praise among men</hi> is another corrupt Affection of mind of the same nature and efficacy with that before named. This is so branded by our Saviour as an insuperable obstacle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the admission of <hi>Sacred Light</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:200371:81"/> Truth, that no more need be added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, see <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 44. chap. 12. 43.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>a Pertinacious adherence unto corrupt Traditions, and inveterate Errors</hi> quite shuts up the way unto all Wisdom and Spiritual Understanding. This ruined the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, and makes at present that of the <hi>Romanists</hi> incurable. What their fore-fathers have professed, what themselves have imbibed from their infancy, what all their outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are involved in, what they have advantage by, what is in Reputation with those in whom they are principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that shall be the <hi>Truth</hi> with them and nothing else. Unto persons whose minds are wholly vitiated with the Leaven of this corrupt Affection; there is not a line in the Scripture whose sense can be truly and clearly represented. All appears in the colour and figure that their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices frame in their Minds. When the Lord Christ came forth first unto the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, there <hi>came a voice from Heaven saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him:</hi> Math. 17. 5. Neither was this Command given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them alone who heard it immediatly from the <hi>excellent Glory,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> speaks,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:200371:81"/> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. but as Recorded in the Word, is given equally unto every one, that would learn any thing of the Mind and Will of God in a due manner. No man can learn but by the <hi>hearing of him;</hi> unto him are we sent for the learning of our Spiritual Knowledge. And no other way doth he speak unto us but by his Word and Spirit. But where the minds of Men are prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with apprehensions of what they have received from the Authority of other Teachers, they have neither Desire, Design, Readiness, nor Willingness to hear <hi>him.</hi> But if men will not forego all praeimbibed Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, prejudices and conceptions of Mind however rivited into them by Traditions, Custome, Veneration of Elders, and secular Advantages, to hearken unto and receive whatever he shall speak unto them, and that with an humble, lowly frame of Heart, they will never learn the Truth, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>a full assurance of Ʋnderstanding</hi> in the mysteries of God. These inveterate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, are at this day those which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally shut out the Truth, and set men together by <hi>the ears</hi> all the World over about Religion and the concerns thereof. Hence is all the Strife, Rage, Tumult, and Persecution that the World is filled withal.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:200371:82"/> Could men but once agree to lay down all those Presumptions which either Wit or Learning, or Custome, or Interest and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have influenced them withal, at the feet of Jesus Christ, and resolve in sincerity to comply with that alone which he doth teach them, and to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go whatever is inconsistent therewith, the waies unto <hi>Truth and Peace</hi> would be more laid open then otherwise they are like to be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Spiritual Sloth</hi> is of the same nature, and produceth the same Effect. The Scripture frequently giveth us in charge to use the utmost of our diligence in the <hi>search</hi> of, and for the finding out of Spiritual Truth, proposing unto us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of those that have done so before, <hi>Jos.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. And any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man would judge that if it had not been so expresly given us in charge from God himself, if it had not been a means appointed and sanctified unto this End, yet that the <hi>nature of the thing</hi> it self, with its importance unto our Duty and Blessedness, are sufficient to convince us of its necessity. It is <hi>Truth,</hi> it is <hi>Heavenly Truth</hi> we enquire after;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:200371:82"/> that, on the Knowledge or Ignorance whereof, our Eternal Blessedness or Misery doth depend. And in a due perception thereof alone, are the faculties of our minds perfected according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which they are capable of in this life. Therein alone can the mind of man find rest, peace and satisfaction, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it must alwaies wander in restless un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, and disquieting vanities. It is a notion implanted on the minds of all men, that all <hi>Truth lies deep,</hi> and that there is great difficulty in the attainment of it. The minds of most are imposed on by specious appearances of falshood. Wherefore all wise men have agreed that <hi>without our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most care and diligence</hi> in the Investigation of the Truth, we must be contented to walk in the shades of Ignorance and Error. And if it be thus in earthly things, how much more is it so in heavenly? As spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>supernatural Truth</hi> is incomparably to be valued above that which relates unto things natural; so it is more obstruse, and of a more difficult investigation. But this <hi>folly</hi> is befallen the minds of the generality of men, that of all things they suppose there is least need of pains and diligence to be used in an enquiry after those things
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:200371:83"/> which <hi>the Angels themselves desire to bow down and look into,</hi> and which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old enquired and searched after with all diligence. Whatever be their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, yet practically it is evident, that most men through <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Sloth,</hi> and <hi>love of Sin,</hi> are wholly negligent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. At least they will not apply themselves to those Spiritual Means, without the use whereof the knowledge of <hi>Divine Truth</hi> will not be attained. It is generally sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that men may be as wise in these things as they need to be, at a very easy rate. The folly of men herein can never be enough bewailed; they regard Spiritual Truth as if they had no concernment in it, beyond what Custom and Tradition puts them on, in reading Chapters, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons: They are wholly under the power of <hi>Sloth,</hi> as unto any means of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Some indeed will labour diligently in the study of those things which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath in common with other <hi>Arts and Sciences;</hi> such are the Languages wherein it was writ, the Stories contained in it, the waies of arguing which it useth with <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical Accuracy</hi> in expressing the Truth supposed to be contained in it. These
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:200371:83"/> things are great in themselves, but go for nothing when they are alone. Men under the utmost efficacy of <hi>Spiritual Sloth</hi> may be diligent in them, and make a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in their improvement. But they are Spiritual Objects and Duties that this Sloth prevails to alienate the minds of men from, and make them negligent of; and what are those Duties I shall afterwards mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
               <p>The consideration I say of the state of things in the world. gives so great an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of probability, that, what through the <hi>Pride and Self-conceit</hi> of the minds of many, refusing a compliance with the Means of Spiritual Knowledge, and exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all gracious qualifications indispensibly required unto the attaining of it. What through the <hi>power of corrupt Traditions,</hi> imprisoning the minds of men in a fatal adherence unto them, preventing all thoughts of an holy ingenious enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mind of God, by the only safe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Revelation of it; and what <hi>through the power of Spiritual Sloth</hi> indisposing the minds of the most unto an immediate search of the Scripture; partly with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of its difficulty, and notions of learning the Truth contained in it by other
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:200371:84"/> means; and what through a <hi>Traditional course of studying Divinity,</hi> as an Art or Science to be learned out of the Writings of Men; the number is very small of them who diligently, humbly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously endeavour to learn the Truth from the voice of God in the Scripture, or to grow wise in the Mysteries of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by such waies as wherein alone that Wisdom is attainable. And is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if many, the greatest number of men, wander after vain imaginations of their own or others, whilst the Truth is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or despised?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, there is in the minds of men by nature a <hi>Love of Sin,</hi> which causeth them to <hi>hate the Truth;</hi> and none can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it but those that love it. In the Visible Church most men come to know of the Truth of the Gospel as it were whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no. And the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it they find to be a <hi>separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their sins.</hi> This sets them at a distance from it in affection, whereon they can never make any near approach unto it in knowledge or understanding. So we are assured, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19, 20. <hi>Light is come into the world, and men love Darkness ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Light, because their deeds are</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:200371:84"/>
                  <hi>evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh unto the Light lest-his deeds should be reproved.</hi> Persons under the power of this frame take up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shades of ignorance, and corrupt imaginations. And if they should attempt to learn the Truth, they would never be able so to do.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Satan by his temptations and suggestions doth variously affect the minds of men, hindering them from discerning the Mind of God as revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>The God of this world blinds the eyes of them that believe not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ who is the Image of God should shine unto them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. The waies and means whereby he doth so, the instruments which he useth, the Artifices and methods which he applieth unto his ends, with his application of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto them according unto all occasions, circumstances, opportunities, and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in great variety, were worth our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into, but that we should too much digress from our present design.</p>
               <p>I have but mentioned these things, and that as <hi>Instances</hi> of the true original causes of the want of understanding, and misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Revelation of the Mind
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:200371:85"/> of God in the Scripture. Many more of the same nature might be added unto them, and their effectual operations unto the same end, be declared. But the mention of them here is only <hi>occasional,</hi> and such as will not admit of a farther discussion. But by these and the like depraved affections it is, that the <hi>Original Darkness</hi> and enmity of the minds of men against Spiritual Truth, and all the Mysteries of it do exert themselves; and from them do all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Superstition, and false Worship that the world is filled withall, proceed. For</p>
               <p>Whilst the minds of men are thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as they cannot understand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Divine Spiritual Truths, in a due manner, so are they ready and prone to embrace whatever is contrary thereunto. If therefore it be the work of the Spirit of God alone in the Renovation of our minds to free them from the power of these <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious depraved habits,</hi> and consequently the advantages that Satan hath against them thereby, there is an especial work of his necessary to enable us to learn the Truth as we ought. And for those who have no regard unto these things, who suppose that in the study of the Scripture all things come alike unto all, to the clean, and to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200371:85"/> the unclean, to the humble and the proud, to them that hate the garments spotted with the flesh, and those that both love sin, and live in it, they seem to know nothing either of the design, nature, power, use or end of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The removal of these hinderances and obstacles is the work of the Spirit of God alone. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. He alone communicates that <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Light</hi> unto our minds, which is the foundation of all our relief against these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles of, and oppositions unto a saving understanding of the Mind of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular he freeth, delivereth, and purgeth our minds from all those <hi>corrupt affections</hi> and prejudices, which are partly inbred in them, partly assumed by them, or imposed on them. For the Artifice of Satan in turning the minds of men from the Truth, is by bringing them under the power of corrupt and vicious habits, which expel that frame of spirit which is indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly necessary unto them that would learn it. It is indeed our <hi>Duty</hi> so to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and purge our selves. We are to cast out all <hi>filthiness and superfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness,</hi> that we <hi>may receive the ingrafted Word with meekness, Jam.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>To purge</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:200371:86"/>
                  <hi>our selves from these things, that we may be vessels unto honour sanctified and meet for our Masters use, and unto every good work,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. If it be not thus with us, let the pride and folly of men pretend what they please, we can neither learn, nor know, nor teach the Mind of God as we ought. And what men may do without giving glory unto God, or the bringing of any spiritual advantage unto their own souls, we enquire not, seeing it belongeth only <hi>equivocally</hi> unto Christian Religion. But although it is our Duty thus to <hi>purge our selves,</hi> yet is it by <hi>the Grace of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit</hi> that so we do. Those who under a pretence of our own Duty would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in any thing the efficacious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghost; or on the other hand, on the pretence of his Grace and its efficacy, would exclude the necessity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in our duties; do admit but of one half of the Gospel, rejecting the other. The whole Gospel asserts and requireth them both unto every good act and work. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>purging of our selves</hi> is that which is not absolutely in the power of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities. For these corrupt affections possess, and are predominant in the mind it self, and all its actings are suited unto
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:200371:86"/> their nature, and influenced by their power. It can never therefore by its own native ability free it self from them. But it is the work of this great Purifier and Sanctifier of the Church, to free our minds from these corrupt affections, and inveterate prejudices, whereby we are alienated from the Truth, and inclined unto all false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Mind of God. And unless this be done, in vain shall we think to learn the Truth as it is in <hi>Jesus.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He implants in our minds <hi>Spiritual Habits and Principles</hi> contrary and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site unto those corrupt affections, whereby they are subdued and expelled. By him are our minds made <hi>humble, meek,</hi> and <hi>teachable,</hi> through a submission unto the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Word, and a conscientious endeavour to conform our selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>It was alwaies agreed that there were ordinarily preparations required unto the receiving of Divine Illuminations; and in the assignation of them many have been greatly deceived. Hence some in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of receiving <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> have been imposed on by <hi>diabolical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:200371:87"/> which by the working of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations they had prepared their minds to give an easie admission unto. So was it among the Heathen of old, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many waies unto this purpose, some of them horrid and dreadful. And so it is still with <hi>all Enthusiasts.</hi> But God himself hath plainly declared what are the <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications</hi> of those souls, which are meet to be made partakers of Divine Teachings, or ever shall be so. And these are, as they are frequently expressed, <hi>meekness, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, godly fear, reverence, submission of soul and conscience</hi> unto the Authority of God, with a <hi>Resolution</hi> and readiness for and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that obedience which he requireth of us, especially that which is internal in the hidden man of the heart. It may be some will judge that we wander very far from the matter of our enquiry; namely, <hi>how we may come unto the Knowledge of the Mind of God in the Scripture,</hi> or we may aright understand the Scripture, when we assign these things as means thereof, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations thereunto. For although these are good things, (for that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied) yet it is <hi>ridiculous</hi> to urge them as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary unto this end, or of any use for the attaining of it. Learning, Arts, Tongues,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:200371:87"/> Sciences, with the Rules of their exercise, and the advantage of <hi>Ecclesiastical Dignity,</hi> are the things that are of use herein, and they alone. The most of these things and sundry other of the same kind, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be of great use unto the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, in their proper place, and what is the due use of them shall be afterwards declared. But we must not forgo what the Scripture plainly instructeth us in, and which the nature of the things themselves doth evidence to be necessary, to comply with the arrogance and fancy of any, or to free our selves from their contempt.</p>
               <p>It is such an understanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the Mind of God therein, as wherein the Spiritual Illumination of our minds doth consist, which we enquire after; such a knowledge as is useful and profitable unto the proper ends of the Scripture towards us, that which we are taught of God, that we may live unto him. These are the ends of all true knowledge. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. And for this end the furnishment of the mind with the graces before mentioned is the best preparation. He bids defiance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gospel by whom it is denied. <hi>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:200371:88"/>
                  <hi>humble.</hi> Whatever be the parts or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, whatever diligence they may use in the investigation of the Truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>disciplinary</hi> knowledge they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereby, the Spirit of God never did, nor ever will, instruct <hi>a proud unhumbled soul</hi> in the right knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it is a Divine Revelation. It is by these <hi>gracious Qualifications alone</hi> whereby we may be enabled to cast out all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness so as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ingrafted Word with meekness, which is able to save our souls.</p>
               <p>Our blessed Saviour tells us, <hi>that unless we be converted, and become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18. 3. We cannot do so, unless we become <hi>humble, meek, tender, weaned from high thoughts of our selves,</hi> and are purged from prejudices by corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And I value not that knowledge which will not conduct us into the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> or which shall be thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. So God hath promised that <hi>the meek he will guide in judgment, the meek he will teach his way; the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his Covenant; And what man is he that feareth the Lord, him shall he teach in</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:200371:88"/>
                  <hi>the way, Psal.</hi> 25. 9, 12, 14. And so we are told plainly that <hi>evil men understand not Judgement, but they that fear the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all things,</hi> Prov. 28. 5.</p>
               <p>Now all these Graces whereby men are made teachable, capable of divine myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so as to <hi>learn the truth as it is in Jesus,</hi> to understand the mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are wrought in them by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; belong unto his work upon our minds in our illumination. Without this the <hi>Hearts</hi> of all men are <hi>fat,</hi> their <hi>ears heavy,</hi> and their <hi>eyes sealed,</hi> that they can neither hear, nor perceive nor understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>These things belong unto the work of the Holy Spirit upon our minds: (as also sundry other instances might be given unto the same purpose) in our illumination, or his enabling of us rightly to understand the mind of God in the Scripture. But whereas whoever is thus by him <hi>graciously prepared</hi> and disposed, shall be taught in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the will of God, so far as he is concerned to know it in point of Duty, if so be he abide in the ordinary use of outward means, so there are sundry other things necessary unto the attaining of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther useful degrees of this knowledge and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:200371:89"/> understanding: whereof I shall treat after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The work of the Holy Spirit in the Composing and Disposal of the Scripture as a means of sacred illumination; the Perspicuity of the Scripture unto the understanding of the mind of God declared and vindicated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is yet another part of the work of the Holy Spirit with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Illumination</hi> of our minds, which must also be enquired into. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self. For this he hath so given out, and so disposed of, as that it should be a moral way or means for the communication of <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> unto the minds of men. For this also is an effect of his infinite wisdome and care of the Church designing to enlighten our minds with the knowledge of God, he prepared apt Instruments for that end. That therefore which we shall declare on this Head of our Discourse is, That <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:200371:89"/>
                  <hi>Holy Spirit of God hath prepared and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the Scripture, so, as it might be a most sufficient and absolutely perfect way and means of communicating unto our minds that saving knowledge of God and his will which is needful that we may live unto him, and come unto the enjoyment of him in his Glory.</hi> And here sundry things must be observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Holy Spirit hath not in the Scripture reduced and <hi>disposed its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or supernatural Truths into any sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme, Order or Method.</hi> Into such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod are the principal of them disposed in our <hi>Catechismes</hi> and <hi>Systemes of Divinity, Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Confessions of Faith.</hi> For whereas the doctrinal Truths of the Scripture have a mutual respect unto, and dependence on one another, they may be disposed into such an order to help the understandings and memories of men. There is indeed in some of the <hi>Epistles of Paul,</hi> especially that unto the <hi>Romans</hi> a methodical dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the most important Doctrines of the Gospel. And from thence are the best methods of our Teaching borrowed. But <hi>in the whole Scripture</hi> there is no such thing aimed at. It is not distributed into <hi>Common Places,</hi> nor are all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Truth <hi>methodically</hi> disposed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200371:90"/> under the same Head: but its contexture and frame is quite of another nature. From this consideration some think they have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to charge the Scripture with <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity:</hi> and do thereon maintain that it was never intended to be such a <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Doctrines</hi> as should be the rule of our Faith. Had it been so, the Truths to be believed would have been proposed in some order unto us, as a <hi>Creed,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of Faith, that we might at once have had a view of them, and been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. But whereas they are now left to be gathered out of a <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Histories, Prophesies, Prayers, Songs, Letters</hi> or <hi>Epistles,</hi> such as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is composed of, they are difficult to be found, hard to be understood, and never perfectly to be learned. And doubtless the way fancied would have been excellent had God designed to effect in us, only an <hi>Artificial</hi> or <hi>Methodical Faith</hi> and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But if we have a due regard unto the <hi>use of the Scripture</hi> and the ends of God therein, there is no weight in this objection. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evident that the whole of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the <hi>Advancement of mens own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> and imaginations against the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:200371:90"/> Will and Wisdome of God. It is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reason to prove this the <hi>Absolute best way</hi> for the disposal of divine Revelations, because God hath made use of this and no other. One indeed is reported to have said, that had he been <hi>present at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ʋniverse, he would have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some things into a better order, than what they are in.</hi> For vain man would be wise, though he be like the wild Asses Colt. And no <hi>wiser</hi> or better are the thoughts, that the Revelation of supernatural truths, might have been <hi>otherwise disposed of</hi> with respect unto the end of God, then as they are in the Scripture. God puts not such value upon mens <hi>accurate methods</hi> as they may imagine them to deserve. Nor are they so subservient unto his ends in the Revelation of himself, as they are apt to fancy (yea, oft times when as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they have brought Truths unto the <hi>strictest propriety of expression,</hi> they lose both their Power and their Glory. Hence is the World filled with so many <hi>lifeless, sapless, graceless,</hi> artificial declarations of divine Truth in the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and others. We may sooner squeeze water out of a pumice stone, then one drop of Spiritual nourishment out of them. But how many
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:200371:91"/> millions of Souls have received divine Light and consolation suited unto their condition in those <hi>occasional occurrences</hi> of truth which they meet withall in the Scripture, which they would never have obtained in those wise <hi>Artificial Disposals of them</hi> which some men would fancy. Truths have their power and efficacy upon our minds, not only from <hi>themselves,</hi> but from their <hi>positure</hi> in the Scripture. There are they placed in such <hi>Aspects</hi> towards, in such <hi>conjunctions</hi> one with another, as that their <hi>influences</hi> on our minds do greatly depend thereon. He is no <hi>wise man,</hi> nor exercised in those things, who would part with any one truth out of its proper place where the holy Spirit hath disposed and fixed it. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith of Gods testimonies, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the men of his Counsel,</hi> Psal. 119. 24. And no man will make choice of a <hi>Counsellor,</hi> all whose wisdom consists in <hi>sayings</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> cast into a certain <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Method.</hi> He alone is a good <hi>Counsellor,</hi> who out of the largeness and wisdome of his own Heart and mind, can give advice according unto all present occasions and circumstances. Such Counsellors are the Testimonies of God. Artificial Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Spiritual Truths, may make men
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:200371:91"/> ready in notions, cunning and subtle in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, but it is the Scripture it self that is able to <hi>make us wise unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the writing and composing of the Holy Scripture, the Spirit of God had respect unto the <hi>various states and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church.</hi> It was not given for the use of one Age or Season only, but for all Generations, for a Guide in Faith and Obedience from the beginning of the World to the end of it. And the state of the Church was not always to be the same, neither in Light, Knowledge, nor Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. God had so disposed of things in the eternal Counsel of his Will, that it should be carried on by various <hi>degrees of divine Revelation</hi> unto its perfect estate. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the Revelation of his Mind in the Scripture subservient and suited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. If all divine Truths had from the first been stated and fixed in a <hi>Systeme of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> the state of the Church must have been always the same, which was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the whole design of divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in those things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such a <hi>Systematical Proposal of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> Truths, or Articles of Faith as some require, would not have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the great ends of the Scripture it self.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:200371:92"/> All that can be supposed of benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, is only, that it would lead us more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily into a <hi>Methodical comprehension</hi> of the Truths so proposed. But this we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and not be rendred one jot more <hi>like unto God</hi> thereby. The principal end of the Scripture is of another nature. It is to be get in the minds of men, Faith, Fear, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Reverence of God, to make them Holy and Righteous; and those such as have in themselves various Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, Temptations, and Inclinations unto the contrary, which must be obviated and subdued. Unto this end every Truth is disposed of in the Scripture as it ought to be. If any expect that the Scripture should be written with respect unto <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Notions,</hi> and <hi>Speculations,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men <hi>skilfull</hi> and cunning in them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to talk and dispute about <hi>all things</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> they are mistaken. It is given us to make us <hi>Humble, Holy, Wise</hi> in Spiritual things, to direct us in our <hi>Duties,</hi> to relieve us against <hi>Temptations,</hi> to comfort us under <hi>Troubles,</hi> to make us to love God and to live unto him, in all that variety of Circumstances, Occasions, Temptations, Trials, Duties, which in this World we are called unto. Unto this end
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:200371:92"/> there is a more glorious Power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in one <hi>Epistle,</hi> one <hi>Psalm,</hi> one <hi>Chapter,</hi> then in all the writings of men, though they have their use also. He that hath not experience hereof, is a stranger unto the Power of God in the Scripture Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the design and scope of the place, sometimes the circumstances related unto, mostly that <hi>Spirit of Wisdome and Holiness</hi> which evidenceth it self in the whole, do effectually influence our minds. Yea sometimes an <hi>occasional passage in a story,</hi> a word or expression shall contribute more to excite Faith and Love in our Souls, then a Volume of learned Disputations. It doth not <hi>argue, syllogize,</hi> or <hi>allure</hi> the mind; but <hi>enlightens, perswades, constrains</hi> the Soul unto Faith and Obedience. This it is prepared for and suited unto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Disposition of divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Scripture is <hi>subservient unto other ends</hi> also of the Wisdom of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church, some of them may be named.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To render useful and necessary the great Ordinance of the Ministry.</hi> God hath not designed to instruct and save his Church by any one outward Ordinance only. The ways and means of doing good unto us,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:200371:93"/> so as that all may issue in his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, are known unto infinite wisdome only. The institution of the whole <hi>series and complex</hi> of divine Ordinances, is no otherwise to be accounted for but by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and submission thereunto. Who can deny but that God might both have instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, sanctified, and saved us, without the use of <hi>some</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of those institutions which he hath obliged us unto. His infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>wise Will</hi> is the only reason of these things. And he will have every one of his Appointments on which he hath <hi>put his name</hi> to be honoured, such is the <hi>Ministry.</hi> A means this is not <hi>coordinate</hi> with the Scripture, but <hi>subservient</hi> unto it. And the great end of it is, that those who are called thereunto, and are furnished with Gifts for the discharge of it, might dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently <hi>search the Scripture,</hi> and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Mind of God revealed therein. It was, I say, the Will of God, that the Church should ordinarily be always under the conduct of such a <hi>Ministry.</hi> And his will it is, that those who are called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, should be furnished with <hi>peculiar spiritual Gifts,</hi> for the finding out and declaration of the Truths that are treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in the Scripture, unto all the ends
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:200371:93"/> of divine Revelation. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. The Scripture therefore is such a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as doth suppose and make necessary this Ordinance of the Ministry, wherein and whereby God will also be Glorified. And it were well if the <hi>nature and Duties</hi> of this office were better <hi>understood</hi> then they seem to be. God hath accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Revelation of himself in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with respect unto them. And those by whom the due discharge of this office is despised or neglected, do sin greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Authority, Wisdom and Love of God. And those do no less by whom it is assumed, but not rightly understood, or not duly improved.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, Why did not <hi>the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost dispose of all things so plainly in the Scripture, that every individual Person might have attained the knowledge of them without the use of this Ministry.</hi> I answer, (1.) It is a proud and foolish thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for any Reasons of the ways and works of God, antecedent unto his own will. <hi>He worketh all things according to the Counsel of his will, Ephes.</hi> 1. 11. and therein are we to acquiesce. Yet we may see the Wisdom of <hi>what he hath done.</hi> As
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:200371:94"/> herein (1.) He would glorifie his own Power, in working great effects by <hi>vile weak means,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. (2.) He did it to magnifie his Son Jesus Christ in the communication of <hi>Spiritual Gifts, Act.</hi> 2. 33. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. (3.) To shew that in and by the work of his Grace he designed not to destroy or contradict the faculties of our nature which at first he created; he would work on them, and work a change in them, by means suited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their constitution and nature; which is done in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Disposition of the Scripture</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Duty of all Believers in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Faith and Obedience▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey know that all their Light and direction, all their springs of spiritual strength and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are treasured up in the Scripture. But in the unspeakable variety of their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they know not <hi>where every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar provision for these ends</hi> is stored. Hence it is their Duty to <hi>meditate on the word night and day,</hi> to search for Wisdom as Silver, and to dig for it as for hidden treasure, <hi>that they may understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God, Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. And this being a Duty whereunto the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:200371:94"/> of all Grace is required, they are all improved thereby. The Soul which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by engaged unto constant converse with God, will thrive more in that which is the proper end of the Scripture; namely, <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> then it could do under any other kind of Teaching.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A continual search into the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without a neglect of any part of it,</hi> is hereby rendred necessary; And hereby are our Souls prepared on all occasions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced in the whole course of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For the whole and every part of the word is blessed unto our good, accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to the Prayer of our Saviour. <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth, Joh.</hi> 17. 17. There is Power put forth in and by every part and parcel of it, unto our sanctification. And there is such a distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>useful Truths</hi> through the whole, that every where we may meet with what is prepared for us, and suited unto our condition. It is to me no small Argument of the <hi>divine original of the Scripture,</hi> and of the presence of God in it, that there is no <hi>Thought of our Hearts</hi> with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the proper end of the Scripture; that is, our living unto God, so as to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enjoyment of him, but that we shall
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:200371:95"/> find at one time or other, a due <hi>adjustment</hi> of it therein in one place or other.</p>
               <p>There can no <hi>Frame</hi> befall the Hearts of Believers, as unto Spiritual things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be as unto their <hi>thriving</hi> or <hi>decays,</hi> but there is a disposition of Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for it; and oft times we shall find it then opening it self when we least looked for it. <hi>Powerful Instructions as unto our practice</hi> do often arise out of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, occasional words and expressions, all arguing an infinite wisdom in their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whereunto every future occurrence was in open view from eternity, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent divine efficacy in the words applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it self unto our Souls. How often in the reading of it, do we meet with, and are as it were surprized with <hi>gracious words,</hi> that enlighten, quicken, comfort, endear, and engage our Souls? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we find Sin wounded, Grace encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, Faith excited, Love inflamed, and this in that endless variety of inward frames and outward occasions, which we are liable unto? I shall say with confidence, that he never was acquainted with the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Scripture,</hi> with its Power and Efficacy in any holy experience, who is capable of fancying that divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:200371:95"/> might have been disposed unto more Advantage with respect unto our living unto God. And these things are sufficient for the removal of the Objection before mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Holy Spirit hath so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the Scripture, <hi>that the Mind of God in all things concerning our Faith and Obedience, in the knowledge whereof our Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination doth consist, is clearly revealed therein.</hi> There needs no other Argument to prove any thing <hi>not to belong</hi> unto our Religion, then that it is <hi>not revealed,</hi> or appointed in the Scripture; no other to prove any Truth not to be <hi>indispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> unto our Faith or Obedience, then that it is not <hi>clearly revealed</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But in this Assertion we must take along with us these two suppositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we look on the Scripture and receive it <hi>not as the word of men,</hi> but as it is indeed the <hi>word of the living God.</hi> If we look for that <hi>perspicuity</hi> and <hi>clearness</hi> in the expression of divine Revelation, which men endeavour to give unto the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their minds in things natural, by Artificial methods and order, by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of words and terms invented and disposed of on purpose to accommodate
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:200371:96"/> what is spoken unto the common notions and Reasonings of men, we may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken. Nor would it have become di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom and Authority to have made use of such methods, ways or Arts. There is that <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>perspicuity</hi> in it which becomes the Holy wise God to make use of, whose words are to be received with Reverence, with submission of Mind and Conscience unto his Authority; and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer that we may understand his Mind and do his Will. Thus all things are made plain unto the meanest Capacity; yet not so, but if the most wise and learned do not see the characters of infinite divine wisdom on things that seem most obvious and most exposed unto vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, they have no <hi>true wisdom</hi> in them. In those very <hi>Foords</hi> and appearing <hi>Shallows</hi> of this River of God, where the <hi>Lamb</hi> may wade, the <hi>Elephant</hi> may swim: Every thing in the Scripture is so plain as that the <hi>meanest Believer</hi> may understand all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto his Duty, or is necessary unto his happiness; yet is nothing so plain, but that the wisest of them all have Reason to adore the depths and stores of divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it. All apprehensions of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity of the Scripture arise from one of those two causes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:200371:96"/> 1. That the minds of men are prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with <hi>Opinions, Dogms, Principles,</hi> and Practices in Religion, received by Tradition from their Fathers; or have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and corrupt inclinations, unto such ways, practices and opinions, as suit their carnal Reason and Interest. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if such Persons conceive the Scripture <hi>dark and obscure.</hi> For they can neither find that in it which they most desire, nor can understand what is revealed in it, because opposite unto their prejudices, affections and interests. The design of the Scripture is to <hi>destroy that frame of mind in them which they would have established.</hi> And no man is to look for <hi>Light</hi> in the Scripture, to give countenance unto his own <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It will appear <hi>obscure</hi> unto all men who come to the reading and study of it in the <hi>meer strength of their own natural Abilities.</hi> And it may be it is on this account that some have esteemed <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>one of the obscurest writers that ever they read.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a Book written in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> must be obscure unto them who have no skill in those Languages; So will the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be unto all, who are unfurnished with those Spiritual preparations which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:200371:97"/> unto the right understanding of it. For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is supposed when we assert the <hi>clearness and perspicuity</hi> of the Scripture, that there is unto the understanding of it use made of that <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> of the Spirit of God concerning which we do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Without this the <hi>clearest Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of divine supernatural things, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as wrapt up in Darkness and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity: not for want of <hi>Light</hi> in them, but for want of <hi>Light</hi> in us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by asserting the necessity of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Illumination, for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of divine Revelation, we no way impeach the <hi>perspicuity</hi> of the Scripture. All things wherein our Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are concerned are clearly declared therein; Howbeit when all is done, <hi>the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, nor can know them,</hi> until the eyes of his understanding be enlightened.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Holy Spirit hath so disposed the Scripture, that notwithstanding that <hi>perspicuity</hi> which is in the whole with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto its proper end, yet are there in sundry parts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. There are in the Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Things <hi>deep, wonderful, mysterious,</hi> such as in their own nature do absolutely exceed the whole compass of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing or Reason, as unto a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect comprehension of them. Nor ought it to be strange unto any that sundry <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations</hi> should be of things in their own nature incomprehensible. For as unto us, many earthly and natural things are so, as <hi>David</hi> affirms concerning the forming of our natures in the Womb, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 5, 6, 14, 15, 16. And our Saviour as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us that Heavenly things are much more above our comprehension then Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12. Such as these are the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or the subsistence of one <hi>single divine nature in three Persons;</hi> The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Christ, or the Assumption of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature into personal Union and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence with the Son of God; The <hi>eternal Decrees</hi> of God, their nature, order, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and effects; the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead, the <hi>Manner</hi> of the operations of the Holy Spirit in forming the new creature in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:200371:98"/> us, and sundry others. Our rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in their utmost improvement in this World, and under the highest advantage they are capable of by Spiritual Light and Grace, are not able with all their <hi>search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to find out the <hi>Almighty</hi> unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in these things. And in all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the Light of Glory: as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we shall be able thereby to behold the Essence of God, to discern the depths of the Mystery of the Incarnation, and the like; men do but darken <hi>counsel by words without Knowledge,</hi> and talk of what they neither do nor can understand. But yet the wisdom of the Holy Spirit hath in these things two ways provided that we shall not suffer from our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that whatever is necessary for us to believe concerning these things is <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly revealed</hi> in the Scripture, and that Revelation declared in such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and Expressions as are obvious unto our understandings. And he who thinks we can believe nothing as <hi>unto its Truth,</hi> but what we can comprehend as unto its <hi>Nature,</hi> overthrows all Faith and Reason also. And propositions may be clear unto us in their sense, when their Subject
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:200371:98"/> matter is incomprehensible. For instance, consider the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> and the <hi>Hypostatical Ʋnion</hi> therein of the divine and humane natures, it is a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Reason and Comprehension. But in the Scripture it is plainly asserted and declared; that the <hi>Word which is God, and was with God, was made flesh; that God was manifest in the flesh, that the Son of God was made of a woman, made under the Law, that he took on him the seed of</hi> Abraham; <hi>that he came of the Jews according to the flesh, who is over all God blessed for ever; and that so God redeemed his Church with own blood.</hi> Thus plainly and perspicuously is this great matter, as it is the object of our Faith, as it is proposed unto us to be believed, declared and expressed unto us. If any one shall now say, that he will <hi>not believe that to be the sense of these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> which the words do plainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably manifest so to be, and are withall incapable of any other sense or constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; because he cannot understand or comprehend the thing it self which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby, it is plainly to say that he will believe nothing on the Authority and Veracity of God revealing it; but what he can comprehend by his own Reason
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:200371:99"/> that he will believe; which is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all Faith divine. The reason of our believing if we believe at all, is Gods <hi>Revelation of the Truth,</hi> and not our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the nature of the things revealed. Thereinto is our Faith resolved, when our reason reacheth not unto the nature and existence of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And the work of the Spirit it is, to <hi>bring into captivity</hi> unto the obedience of the Truth, every thought that might arise from our Ignorance, or the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of our minds to comprehend the things to be believed. And that new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Socinianism</hi> which pretends to reduce all to Reason, is wholly built upon the most irrational Principle that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver befell the minds of men. It is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: <hi>What we cannot comprehend in things divine and infinite as unto their own nature, that we are not to believe in their Revelation.</hi> On this ground alone do the men of that perswasion reject the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of the Incarnation of the Son of God, of the Resurrection of the dead, and the like mysteries of Faith. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Testimony the Scripture gives unto them, because their Reason cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, they profess they will not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:200371:99"/> believe them. A Principle wild and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and which leads unto <hi>Atheism,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the being of God it self is absolutely incomprehensible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Degree of Knowledge which we can attain in and about these things is <hi>every way sufficient with respect unto the end of the Revelation it self.</hi> If they were so proposed unto us, as that if we could not fully comprehend them, we should have no benefit or advantage by them; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation it self would be lost, and the end of God frustrated therein. But this could not become divine wisdom and Goodness to make such propositions unto us. For this defect ariseth not from any blamable <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our nature</hi> as corrupted, but from the very <hi>Essence and Being</hi> of it as created: For being finite and limited, it cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly comprehend things infinite. But whatever Believers are able to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in that variety of the degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which in their several circumstances they do attain, is <hi>sufficient</hi> unto the end whereunto it is designed; that is, sufficient to ingenerate, cherish, encrease and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Faith and Love, and Reverence with holy obedience in them, in such a way and manner as will assuredly bring them unto
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:200371:100"/> the end of all Supernatural Revelation in the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are in the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Some things that are <hi>hard to be interpreted;</hi> not from the <hi>nature</hi> of the things revealed, but from the <hi>manner</hi> of their Revelation. Such are many <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Parables, mystical Stories, Allusions, unfulfilled Prophesies</hi> and <hi>Predictions, Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> unto the then <hi>present customs, persons</hi> and <hi>places, computation of Times, Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> the <hi>signification of some single words seldom or but once used</hi> in the Scripture, the names of <hi>divers Birds</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> unknown to us. Such things have a difficulty in them from the <hi>manner</hi> of their declaration. And it is hard to find out, and it may be in some instances impossible unto any determinate certainty, the proper genuine sense of them in the places where they occur. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also we have a <hi>Relief</hi> provided in the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, in giving the whole Scripture for our Instruction, against any <hi>disadvantage</hi> unto our Faith or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Whatever is <hi>so delivered</hi> in any place, if it be of importance for us to know and believe as unto the ends of divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is in some other place or places
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:200371:100"/>
                  <hi>unveiled</hi> and plainely declared, so that we may say of it as the Disciples said unto our Saviour; <hi>Loe now he speaketh plainely and not in Parables.</hi> There can be no instance given of any obscure place or passage in the Scripture, concerning which a man may rationally suppose or conjecture, that there is any <hi>Doctrinal Truth</hi> requiring our obedience contained in it, which is not elsewhere explained. And there may be several Reasons why the Holy Spirit chose to express his mind at any time in such waies as had so much <hi>obscurity</hi> attending of them. (1.) As for <hi>Types, Allegories, Mystical Stories,</hi> and <hi>Obscure Predictions,</hi> he made use of them on purpose under the old Testament to draw a <hi>Vail</hi> over the things signified in them, or the Truths taught by them. For the Church was not yet to be acquainted with the clear Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the things concerning Jesus Christ and his mediation; they had not so much as a <hi>perfect Image</hi> of the things themselves, but only an <hi>Obscure shadow</hi> or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Good things to come: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. To have given unto them <hi>a full and clear Revelation</hi> of all divine truths would have cast the whole design of God for the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous states of the Church, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:200371:101"/> of the great work of his Grace and Love, into disorder. It was not hard then for the Church to be taught of old in <hi>Types and Allegorys,</hi> but it was much Grace and mercy that through them the light of the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> so far beamed on them, as enabled them comfortably to wait untill the day did break and the shadows flee away; as <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 6. The fulness and glory of the Revelation of <hi>Grace and Truth</hi> was reserved for Jesus Christ. God did them no wrong, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>better things for us, Heb.</hi> 11. last</p>
               <p> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) Whatever seems yet to be continued under any obscurity of Revelation, it is so continued for the <hi>exercise of our Faith, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Humility and Dependance on God,</hi> in our enquirys into them. And suppose we do not alwaies attain precisely unto the proper and peculiar intendment of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in them, as we can never search out his mind unto Perfection, yet are there so many and great advantages to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the due exercise of those graces in the study of the word, that we can be no <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sers</hi> by any difficulties we can meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The rule in this case is, that we <hi>affix no sense unto any obscure or difficult passage of Scripture, but what is materially true,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:200371:101"/>
                  <hi>and consonant unto other express and plain Testimonies.</hi> For men to raise peculiar sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from such places, not confirmed else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, is a dangerous curiosity.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) As to sundry <hi>Prophecies of future Revolutions in the Church and the world,</hi> like those in the Revelation, there was an indispensible necessity of giving them out in that obscurity of <hi>Allegorical expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Representations</hi> wherein we find them. For I could easily manifest, that as the clear and determinate declaration of <hi>future events</hi> in plain <hi>Historical expressions</hi> is contrary to the nature of <hi>Prophecy:</hi> so in this case it would have been a means of bringing confusion on the works of God in the World, and of turning all men out of the way of their Obedience. Their present Revelation is sufficient to guide the Faith, and regulate the Obedience of the Church so far as they are concerned in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some things are in the Scripture dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on purpose that <hi>evil, perverse,</hi> and <hi>proud men</hi> may <hi>stumble and fall at them,</hi> or be further hardened in their unbelief and obstinacy. So our Lord Jesus Christ affirms that he spake unto the <hi>stubborn Jews in Parables that they might not understand.</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:200371:102"/> And whereas there must be <hi>Heresies,</hi> that they which <hi>are approved may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. and some <hi>are of old or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained unto this condemnation, Jude</hi> 4. Some things are so declared, that from them proud, perverse and wrangling Spirits may take occasion to wrest them unto their own destruction. The Truths of Christ as well as his Person, are appointed to be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence, yea a gin and a snare unto many. But this, humble teachable Believers are not concerned in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Holy Spirit hath given us a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in this matter by supplying us with a <hi>Rule of the Interpretation of Scripture, which whilst we sincerely attend unto, we are in no danger of sinful corrupting the word of God,</hi> although we should not arrive unto its proper meaning in every particular place. And this Rule is the <hi>Analogy</hi> or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith. <hi>Let him that prophesieth, saith the Apostle,</hi> that is, expoundeth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Church, <hi>Do it according to the proportion of Faith, Rom.</hi> 12. 6. And this <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or Proportion of Faith,</hi> is what is taught plainly and uniformly in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Rule of our Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. When men will engage their enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into parts of the Scripture, <hi>Mystical,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:200371:102"/>
                  <hi>Allegorical,</hi> or <hi>Prophetical,</hi> aiming to find out, it may be, things new and curious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a constant regard unto this <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> it is no wonder if they wander out of the way and err concerning the Truth, as many have done on that occasion. And I cannot but declare my detestation of those bold and curious conjectures which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard unto the <hi>Rule of Prophesie</hi> many have indulged themselves in, on ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure passages in the Scripture. But now suppose a man brings no preconceived sense or opinion of his own unto such places, seeking countenance thereunto from them, which is the bane of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scripture; suppose him to come in some measure prepared with the spiritual Qualifications before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in all his enquiries have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant due regard unto the <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> so as not to admit of any sense which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth with what is elsewhere plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, such a Person shall not miss of the mind of the Holy Spirit; or if he do, shall be assuredly preserved from any hurtful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his mistakes. For there is that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Relation, one to another, yea that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inbeing of all divine truths, in their proposal and Revelation in the Scripture,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:200371:103"/> as that every one of them is after a sort in every place, though not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly,</hi> yet by <hi>consequence</hi> and <hi>coherence.</hi> Wherefore although a man should miss of the <hi>first proper sense</hi> of any obscure place of Scripture, which with all our diligence we ought to aime at. Yet whilst he receiveth none but what containes a truth agreable unto what is revealed in other places, the error of his mind neither endangereth his own Faith or Obedience, nor those of any others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For those things which are peculiarly difficult, as <hi>Genealogys Chronological compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> oftime, and the like, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental unto the design of the Scripture, those who are able so to do unto their own edification or others may exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein; and by all others, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them in particular, may be safely omitted.</p>
               <p>And these are the Heads of the <hi>work of the Holy Spirit</hi> on our minds, and on the Scriptures, considered distinctly and apart, with reference unto the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>mind of God in them.</hi> By the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sort our <hi>minds</hi> are prepared to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scripture; and by the the latter <hi>Scripture</hi> is prepared and suited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

There yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the consideration of what he doth or what help he affords unto us in the <hi>actual application of our minds unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Interpretation of the word.</hi> And this respecteth the means which we are to make use of unto that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and these also shall be briefly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                  <p>Means to be used for the right understanding of the mind of God in the Scripture. Those which are prescribed in a way of Duty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE means to be used for the right understanding and Interpretation of the Scripture are of two sorts. (1.) That which is general and absolutely necessary; (2.) Such as consist in the due improvement thereof. The first is <hi>diligent reading of the Scripture with a sedate, rational consideration of what we read.</hi> Nothing is more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended unto us; and, not to insist on particular testimonies, the whole 119.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:200371:104"/>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> is spent in the Declaration of this duty, and the benefits which are attained thereby. Herein consists the first natural exercise of our minds in order unto the understanding of it. So the <hi>Eunuch</hi> read and pondered on the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> though of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he could not attain the understanding of what he read, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 30, 31. Either <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or that which is equivalent thereunto, is that whereby we do, and without which it is impossible we should apply our minds to know what is contained in the Scriptures. And this is that which all other means are designed to render useful. Now by this <hi>Reading</hi> I understand that which is <hi>stayed, sedate, considerative,</hi> with respect unto the end, aimed at; <hi>Reading</hi> attended with a due consideration of the things <hi>Read,</hi> enquiry into them, Meditation on them, with a regard unto the designe and scope of the place, with all other advantages for the due Investigation of the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frequent Reading of the Word</hi> more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and cursorily, whereunto all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to be trained from their youth, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.) and which all Clossets and families should be acquainted withal, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8, 9.) Is of great use and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and I shall therefore name some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:200371:104"/> benefits which may be received thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby the minds of men are brought into a <hi>general acquaintance</hi> with the nature and design of the <hi>Book of God,</hi> which some to their present shame, and future ruine, are prodigiously ignorant of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They who are exercised herein, come to know <hi>distinctly</hi> what things are treated of in the <hi>particular Books</hi> and passages of it; whilst others who live in a <hi>neglect of this Duty,</hi> scarce know what Books are <hi>Historical,</hi> what <hi>Prophetical,</hi> or what <hi>Doctrinal</hi> in the whole Bible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereby they exercise themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>thoughts of Heavenly things,</hi> and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converse with God; if they bring along with them as they ought, Hearts <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and sensible of his Authority in the word.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their minds are insensibly furnished with <hi>due conceptions about God, spiritual things, themselves,</hi> and <hi>their conditions;</hi> and their memories with expressions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and meet to be used about them in Prayer or other ways.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God oftentimes takes occasion herein, to <hi>influence their souls</hi> with the efficacy of divine truth in particular, in the way of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:200371:105"/>
                  <hi>Exhortation, Reproof, Instruction</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> whereof all who attend diligently unto this Duty, have experience.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They come by <hi>reason of use</hi> to have their <hi>senses exercised</hi> to discern good and evil, so that if any noxious or corrupt sense of any place of the Scripture be suggested unto them, they have in readiness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to oppose it, from other places from whence they are instructed in the truth.</p>
               <p>And many other Advantages there are which men may reap from the <hi>constant Reading</hi> of the Scripture, which I therefore reckon as a <hi>general means</hi> of coming to the knowledg of the mind of God therein. But this is not that which at present I especially intend. Wherefore</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Reading</hi> of the Scripture, I mean the studying of it in the use of means to come to a due understanding of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places. For it is about the means of the <hi>Solemn Interpretation</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that we now enquire. Hereunto I say the general study of the whole, and in particular the places to be interpreted is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. It may seem altogether needless and impertinent to give this direction, for the understanding of the mind of God in the Scripture, namely, that we should read and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:200371:105"/> study it to that end. For who can imagine how it should be done otherwise. But I wish the practice of many, it may be of the most, did not render this Direction, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. For in their design to come to the knowledg of Spiritual things, the direct immediate study of the Scripture, is that which they least of all apply themselves unto. Other <hi>Writings</hi> they will read and study with diligence. But their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture is for the most part superficial, without that intension of mind and Spirit, that use and application of means which are necessary unto the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it, as the event doth manifest. It is the immeditate study of the Scripture that I intend. And hereunto I do refer, (1) A due consideration of the <hi>Analogy of Faith</hi> alwaies to be retained. (2.) A due <hi>examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the design and <hi>Scope of the place</hi> (3.) A diligent observation of <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Consequents,</hi> with all those general rules which are usually given as directions in the Interpretation of the Scripture. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the diligent exercise of our minds and reasons is the first general outward means of knowing the mind of God in the Scripture, and the Interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The means designed for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:200371:106"/> hereof, or our profitable use of it are of three sorts. 1. <hi>Spiritual.</hi> 2. <hi>Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi> 3. <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> Some instances on each Head will further clear what I intend.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The first thing required as a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual means</hi> is <hi>Prayer.</hi> I intend <hi>fervent and earnest Prayer</hi> for the assistance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, revealing the mind of God as in the whole Scripture, so in particular Books and passages of it. I have proved before that this is both enjoyned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto us by the Practice of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi> And this also by the way invincibly proves, that the due Investiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind of God in the Scripture, is a work above the utmost improvement of natural reason, with all outward Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages whatsoever. For were we sufficient of our selves without immediate divine Aid and assistance for this work, why do we pray for them? with which Argument the antient Church perpetually urged the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as to the necessity of saving Grace. And it may be justly supposed that no man who professeth himself a Christian, can be so forsaken of all sobriety, as once to question whether this be the <hi>Duty of every one</hi> who hath either desire or design to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any real knowledg of the Will of God
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:200371:106"/> in the Scripture. But the practical neglect of this Duty is the true reason why so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are skilful enough in the <hi>discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means of knowledg</hi> are yet such stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the true Knowledg of the Mind of God. And this Prayer is of two sorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which respects the <hi>Teaching of the Spirit</hi> in general, whereby we labour in our Prayers, <hi>that he would enlighten our minds, and lead us into the knowledg of the Truth,</hi> according to the work before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The <hi>importance of this grace</hi> unto our Faith and Obedience, the <hi>multiplied Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of God concerning it, our necessity of it from our natural weakness, ignorance and darkness, should render it a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of our daily supplications. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is this incumbent on them who are called in an especial manner, to <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> and to declare the Mind of God in them unto others. And great are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which a conscientious discharge of this Duty with a due reverence of God brings along with it. Prejudices, precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinions, engagements by secular advantages, false confidences, Authority of men, Influences from Parties and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will be all laid level before it, at least be gradually exterminated out of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:200371:107"/> minds of men thereby. And how much the casting out of all this <hi>Old Leven</hi> tends to prepare the mind for, and to give it a due understanding of divine Revelations, hath been proved before. I no way doubt but that the rise and continuance of all those <hi>enormous errours</hi> which so infest Christian Religion, and which many seek so sedulously to confirm from the Scripture it self, are in a great measure to be ascribed unto the corrupt affections with the power of Tradition, and influences of secular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which cannot firm their station in the minds of them who are constant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere suppliants at the throne of grace to be taught of God what is his mind and will in his word. For it includes a <hi>prevailing resolution</hi> sincerely to receive what we are so instructed in, whatever effects it may have upon the inward or outward man. And this is the only way to preserve our souls under the influences of divine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Irradiation of the Holy Spirit, without which we can neither learn, nor know any thing as we ought. I suppose therefore this may be fixed on as a <hi>Common principle of Christianity;</hi> namely, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and fervent Prayer for the divine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Holy Spirit, is such an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:200371:107"/> means for the attaining the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the mind of God in the Scripure, as that without it all others will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable.</p>
               <p>Nor do I believe that any one who doth, and can thus pray as he ought in a conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious study of the word, shall ever be left unto the <hi>final Prevalency</hi> of any pernitious error; or the Ignorance of any fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal truth. None utterly miscarry in the seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the mind of God, but those who are perverted by their own corrupt minds. Whatever appearance there be of sincerity and diligence in seeking after truth, if men miscarry therein, it is far more safe to judg, that they do so, either through the neglect of this Duty, or indulgence unto some corruption of their hearts and minds, then that God is wanting to reveal himself unto those that diligently seek him. And there are unfailing grounds of this assurance. For (1.) Faith exercised in this Duty will work out all that <hi>filthiness and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of naughtiness,</hi> which would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us so to receive the ingrafted word with meekeness, as that it should save our souls. (2.) It will work in the mind those gracious qualifications of <hi>Humilty and meekness,</hi> whereunto the Teachings of God are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:200371:108"/> in an especial manner, as we have shewed. And (3.) Our Saviour hath assured us, that his <hi>Heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask him. Luk.</hi> 11. 13. Neither is any supplication for the Holy Spirit more acceptable unto God, then that which designs the Knowledg of his mind and will that we may do them. (4) All those <hi>Graces</hi> which render the mind <hi>teachable, and meet unto the reception of Heavenly Truths,</hi> are kept up unto a due exercise therein. If we deceive not our selves in these things, we cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For in the discharge of this Duty those things are learned in their <hi>Power,</hi> whereof we have the <hi>notion</hi> only in other means of Instruction. And hereby what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we learn, is so fixed upon our minds, possesseth them with such power, transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them into the likeness of it, as that they are prepared for the communication of farther Light, and encreases in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Knowledg.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be granted on the other hand, that any sacred Truth is learned in a <hi>due manner,</hi> whatever diligence be used in its acquisition; or that we can know the mind of God in the Scripture in any thing as we ought, when the mannagement of all
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:200371:108"/> other means which we make use of unto that end, is not committed unto the hand of this Duty. The <hi>Apostle</hi> desiring earnestly that those unto whom he wrote, and whom he instructed in the mysteries of the Gospel, might have a due <hi>Spiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> of the mind of God, as revealed and taught in them, prays with all fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of mind, that they might have a <hi>communication of the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation from above</hi> to enable them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. For without this he knew it could not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. That which he did for them, we are obliged to do for <hi>our selves.</hi> And where this is neglected, especially considering that the <hi>supplies of the Spirit</hi> unto this purpose are confined unto them that <hi>ask</hi> him, there is no Ground of expectation, that any one should ever learn the saving Knowledg of the mind of God in a due manner.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore fix this assertion as a sacred truth. <hi>Whoever in the diligent and immediate study of the Scripture to know the mind of God therein so as to do it, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in fervent supplications in and by Jesus Christ for supplies of the Spirit of Grace, to lead him into all truth, to reveal and make known unto him the truth as it is in Jesus, to</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:200371:109"/>
                  <hi>give him an understanding of the Scriptures, and the will of God therein, he shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from pernitious errors, and attain that degree in Knowledg, as shall be suffici-unto the guidance and preservation of the life of God, in the whole of his Faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And more security of truth there is herein, then in mens giving themselves up unto any other conduct in this world whatever. The goodness of God, his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in being the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, the command of this Duty unto this end, the promises annexed unto it, with the whole nature of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do give us the highest security herein. And although these <hi>Duties</hi> cannot but be accompanied with a conscientious care and fear of errors and mistakes, yet the <hi>Persons</hi> that are found in them, have no Ground of troublesome thoughts or fearful suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they shall be deceived or fail in the end they aim at.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Prayer respects <hi>particular occasions,</hi> or especial places of Scripture, whose expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or interpretation we enquire after. This is the great Duty of a <hi>Faithful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> that which in, with, and after the use of all means, he betakes himself unto. An experience of divine guidance and assistance
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:200371:109"/> herein, is that which unto some is unvalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; however by others it be despised. But shall we think it strange for a Christian, when it may be after the use of all other means, he finds himself at a loss about the true meaning and intention of the Holy Spirit in any place or Text of Scripture, to betake himself in a more then ordinary manner unto God by <hi>Prayer,</hi> that he would by his Spirit enlighten, guide, teach, and so reveal the truth unto him: or should we think it strange that God should hear such Prayers, and instruct such persons in the <hi>secrets of his Covenant?</hi> God forbid there should be such <hi>Atheistical</hi> thoughts in the minds of any, who would be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Christians. Yea I must say, that for a man to undertake the interpretation of any part or portion of Scripture in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner without <hi>invocation of God</hi> to be taught and instructed by his Spirit, is an high Provocation of him. Nor shall I expect the discovery of truth from any one who so proudly and ignorantly ingageth in a work so much above his ability to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. I speak this of solemn and stated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations; for otherwise a <hi>Scribe ready furnished for the Kingdom of God,</hi> may as he hath occasion, from the Spiritual Light
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:200371:110"/> and understanding wherewith he is endued, and the stores he hath already received, declare the mind of God unto the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others. But this is the first means to render our <hi>studying of the Scripture</hi> use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual unto the end aimed at.</p>
               <p>This (as was said) is the <hi>sheat Anchor</hi> of a Faithful expositor of the Scripture which he betakes himself unto in all Difficulties. Nor can he without it be lead into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable satisfaction, that he hath attained the mind of the Holy Ghost in any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. When all other helps fail, as he shall in most places find them to do, if he be really intent on the disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, this will yield him his best relief. And so long as this is attended unto, we need not fear farther useful interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Scripture, or the several parts of it, then as yet have been attained unto by the endeavours of others. For the stores of Truth laid up in it, are inexhaustible. And hereby will they be opened unto those that enquire into them with Humility and Diligence. The Labours of those who have gone before us, are of excellent use herein. But they are yet very far from having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the <hi>Depths</hi> of this vein of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Nor will the best of our endeavours
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:200371:110"/> prescribe limits and bounds to them that shall come after us. And the reason why the <hi>Generality of Expositors</hi> go in the same track one after another, seldom passing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the beaten path of former endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, unless it be in some excursions of curiosity, is the want of giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the conduct of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the diligent performance of this Duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>Readiness to receive impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from divine Truths as revealed unto us,</hi> conforming our minds and Hearts unto the Doctrine made known, is another means unto the same end. This is the first end of all divine Revelations of all Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Truths, namely, to beget the Image and likeness of themelves in the minds of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. And we miss our aim if this be not the first thing we intend in the study of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is not to learn <hi>the form of the Doctrine of Godliness,</hi> but to get the <hi>Power</hi> of it implanted in our souls. And this is an eminent means of our making a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in the knowledg of the truth. To seek after meer <hi>notions of Truth,</hi> without an endeavour after an <hi>experience of its Power</hi> in our hearts, is not the way to encrease our
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:200371:111"/> understanding in Spiritual things. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is in a posture to learn from God, who sincerely gives up his mind, conscience and Affections to the power and rule of what is revealed unto him. Men may have in their study of the Scripture other ends also, as the profit and edification of others. <hi>But if this conforming of their own souls unto the Power of the Word,</hi> be not fixed in the first place in their minds, they do not <hi>strive lawfully, nor will be crowned.</hi> And if at any time when we study the word, we have not this design expresly in our minds, yet if upon the discovery of any Truth, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not to have the <hi>likeness of it</hi> in our own Hearts, we lose our principal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Practical obedience in the course of our walking before God,</hi> is another means unto the same end. The Gospel is the <hi>Truth which is according unto Godliness, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. And it will not long abide with any who follow not after godliness according unto its guidance and direction. Hence we see so many to lose that very understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they had of the Doctrines of it, when once they being to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to ungodly lives. The true notion of <hi>holy Evangelical Truths</hi> will not <hi>live,</hi> at
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:200371:111"/> least not <hi>flourish,</hi> where they are divided from an holy conversation. As we learn all to practice, so we learn much by practice. There is no <hi>Practical Science</hi> which we can make any great improvements of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an assiduous practice of its <hi>Theorems.</hi> Much less is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> such as is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the mysteries of the Scripture to be encreased, unless a man be <hi>practically conversant</hi> about the things which it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects unto.</p>
               <p>And herein alone we can come unto the <hi>assurance,</hi> that what we know and learn is indeed the Truth. So our Saviour tells us, <hi>That if any man do the will of God, he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, Joh.</hi> 7. 17. Whilst men learn the Truth only in the notion of it, whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of its being so it is accompanied withal, they will never attain <hi>stability</hi> in their minds concerning it, nor come to the <hi>full assurance of understanding,</hi> unless they continually exemplify it in their own Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, doing the will of God. This is that which will give them a satisfactory perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it. And hereby will they be lead continually into farther degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. For the mind of man is capable of receiving <hi>continual supplies</hi> in the encrease
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:200371:112"/> of Light and Knowledg whilst it is in this world, if so be they are improved unto their proper end in obedience unto God. But without this the mind will be quickly stuffed with notions, so that no streams can descend into it from the Fountain of Truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; A <hi>constant design for growth, and a Progress in Knowledg, out of Love to the Truth, and experience of its excellency,</hi> is usefull, yea needfull unto the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Some are quickly apt to think, that they know <hi>enough,</hi> as much as is needfull for them; some that they know <hi>all</hi> that is to be known, or have a sufficient compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of all the counsels of God as revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture, or as they rather judge of the whole <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> in all the parts of it, which they may have disposed into an exact method with great accuracy and skill. No great or usefull discoveries of the mind of God, shall I expect from such Persons. Another frame of heart and Spirit is required in them who design to be instructed in the mind of God, or to learn it in the study of the Scripture. Such Persons look upon it as a Treasury of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths absolutely unfathomable by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:200371:112"/> any created understandings. The truths which they do receive from thence, and comprehend according to their measure, therein, they judge <hi>amiable, excellent and desirable</hi> above all earthly things. For they find the fruit, benefit and advantage of them, in strengthening the Life of God in them, conforming their souls unto him, communicating of his Light, Love, Grace and Power unto them.</p>
               <p>This makes them with purpose of heart continually to press in the use of all means to <hi>increase in this wisdom, to grow in the Knowledg of God &amp; our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> They are pressing on continually unto that measure of perfection which in this life is attainable. And every new beam of Truth whereby their minds are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, guides them into fresh discoveries of it. This frame of mind is under a promise of divine Teachings, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</hi> If <hi>thou criest after knowledg, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasure, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledg of God. Pro.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5, 6. When men live in an holy Admiration of, and complacency in God,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:200371:113"/> as the God of Truth, as the first infinite essential Truth, in whose enjoyment alone there is fulness of all satisfactory Light and Knowledg; when they adore the fulness of those Revelations of himself which with infinite Wisdom he hath treasured up in the Scriptures; when they find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience an excellency, power, and efficacy in what they have attained unto, and out of a deep sense of the smalness of their measures, of the meanness of their Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how little a Portion it is they know of God, do live in a constant design to abide with Faith and patience in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual study of the word, and enquiries into the Mind of God therein, <hi>they are in the way of</hi> being taught by him, and learning of his Mind, unto all the proper ends of its Revelation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; There are sundry <hi>Ordinances of Spiritual worship</hi> which God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a means of our Illumination: A reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Attendance whereunto is required of them who intend to grow in Grace and in the Knowledg of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And this is <hi>the first Head of means</hi> for the due improvement of our endeavours, in reading and studying of the Scriptures, that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:200371:113"/> we may come thereby unto a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Mind of God in them, and be able to interpret them unto the use and benefit of others. What is the work of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> herein, what is the Aid and Assistance which he contributes hereunto, is so manifest from what we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, especially concerning his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in us as a Spirit of Grace and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, (not yet made publick) that it must not be here insisted on.</p>
               <p>It may be these means will be despised by some, and the proposal of them to this end looked on as weak and ridiculous, if not extreamly <hi>fanciful.</hi> For it is supposed that these things are pressed to no other end but to decry <hi>Learning, study,</hi> and the use of reason in the Interpretation of the Scriptures, which will quickly reduce all Religion into <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> Whether there be any thing of Truth in this suggestion shall be immediately discovered. Nor have those by whom these things are pressed the least reason to decline the use of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or any rational means in their proper place, as though they were conscious to themselves of a deficiency in them with respect unto those by whom they are so highly, and indeed for the most part <hi>vainly</hi> pretended unto.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:200371:114"/>
               <p> But in the matter in hand, we must deal with some confidence. They by whom these things are <hi>decryed,</hi> by whom they are <hi>denyed</hi> to be necessary means for the right understanding of the Mind of God in the Scriptures, do plainly renounce the cheif principles of Christian Religion. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scripture hath many things <hi>in common</hi> with other writings wherein <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Arts and Sciences</hi> are declared; yet to suppose that we may attain the sense and Mind of God in them, by the meer use of such <hi>waies and means</hi> as we apply in the investigation of Truths of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natures, is to exclude all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, of Jesus Christ, of the Holy Spirit, of the end of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of the nature and use of the things delivered in them, and by consequent to overthrow all Religion; see <hi>Pro</hi> 28. 5.</p>
               <p>And this first sort of <hi>means</hi> which we have hitherto insisted on, are <hi>Duties</hi> in themselves as well as means unto farther ends. And <hi>all Duties</hi> under the Gospel are the waies and means wherein, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Graces of God are exercised For as no <hi>Grace</hi> can be exerted or exercised, but in a way of duty, so no duty is <hi>Evangelical</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, but what especial Grace is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:200371:114"/> exercised in. As the word is the Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are guided, directed and measured; so the <hi>acting of Grace in them,</hi> is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are quickned, without which the best Duties are but dead works. <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> they are Duties, but <hi>formally</hi> they are sins. In their performance therefore as Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Duties, and as they are accepted with God, there is an especial Aid and Assistance of the Holy Spirit. And on that account there is so in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For if without his assistance we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make use aright of the means of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of the Scripture, we cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scripture without it. The Truth is, they who shall either say, that these Duties are not necessarily required unto them who would <hi>search the Scripture,</hi> and find out the Mind of God for their own edification, or so as to expound those O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God unto others; or that they may be performed in a manner acceptable unto God, and usefully unto this end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the especial Assistance of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do <hi>impiously</hi> what lies in them evert the whole Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Grace thereof.</p>
               <p>That which in the next place might be insisted on, is the consideration of the <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:200371:115"/>
                  <hi>Rules</hi> which have been or may yet be given for the right Interpretation of the Scriptures. Such are they which concern <hi>the stile</hi> of the Scripture, its especial <hi>Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seology,</hi> the <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> it makes use of, the <hi>Way</hi> of its arguing, the <hi>Times</hi> and seasons wherein it was written, or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of it; the <hi>occasions</hi> under the Guidance of the Spirit of God given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the <hi>design</hi> and scope of <hi>particular Writers,</hi> with what is peculiar unto them in their manner of Writing, the <hi>comparing of several places,</hi> as to their difference in things and expressions, the Reconciliation of seeming contradictions, with other things of an alike nature. But as the most of these may be reduced unto what hath been spoken before, about the <hi>Disposal and Perspicuity</hi> of the Scripture, so they have been already handled by many others at large, and therefore I shall not here insist upon them, but speak only unto the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means that are to be applied unto the same end.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Second sort</hi> of means I call <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian,</hi> as consisting in the due use and improvement of <hi>common Arts and Sciences,</hi> applied unto, and made use of in the study of the Scriptures. And these are things which have no <hi>Moral good</hi> in themselves, but being indifferent in their own nature, their end, with the manner of their mannagement there unto, is the only measure and standard of their worth and value. Hence it is that in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them unto the <hi>Interpretation of the Scripture,</hi> they may be <hi>used aright,</hi> and in a due manner, and they may be <hi>abused</hi> to the great disadvantage of them who use them; and accordingly it hath fallen out. In the first way they receive a <hi>Blessing</hi> from the Spirit of God, who alone prospereth every good and honest indeavour in any kind; &amp; in the latter they are efficacious to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:200371:116"/>
                  <hi>seduce</hi> men unto a Trust in their own un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstandings, which in other things is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and in these things pernitious.</p>
               <p>That which of this sort I prefer in the first place, is the <hi>Knowledg of, and skill in the languages wherein the Scripture was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally written.</hi> For the very words of them therein, were peculiarly from the Holy Ghost, which gives them to be <gap reason="foreign">

The Scriptures of the Old Testament were given unto the Church whilst it was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confined unto one Nation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19. Thence they were all written in that Language which was common among, and peculiar unto that Nation. And this Language, as the People it self, was called <hi>Hebrew</hi> from <hi>Heber</hi> the Son of <hi>Salah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> the Son of <hi>Shem,</hi> their most eminent progenitor, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 23, 24. For being the one Original Tongue of mankind, it remained in some part of his family, who probably joyned not in the <hi>great Apostasy</hi> of the world from God, nor was concerned in their dispersion at the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> which ensued thereon. The Derivation of that name from another
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:200371:116"/>
                  <hi>Original,</hi> is a fruit of curiosity and vain conjecture, as I have elsewhere demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p>In process of time that People were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>Captivity</hi> out of their own Land, and were thereby forced to learn, and use a Language somewhat different from their own; <hi>Another</hi> absolutely it was not, yet so far did it differ from it, that those who knew and spoke the one commonly could not understand the other, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 26. This was <gap reason="foreign">

But by the Peoples long continuance in that country it became common to them all. After this some parts of the Books of the Scripture, as of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> were written in that Language, as also <hi>one</hi> verse in the Prophecy of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> when they were ready to be carried thither, in which he instructs the people how to reproach the Idols of the Nations in their own Language, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 11. The Design of God was that his word should be alwaies read and used in that Language, which was commonly understood by them unto whom he granted the Priviledg thereof, nor could any of the ends of his wisdom and goodness in that merciful Grant, be otherwise attained.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:200371:117"/>
               <p> The Prodigious conceit of <hi>Keeping the Scripture</hi> which is the Foundation, Rule and Guide of the whole Church, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food and means of life unto all the members of it, by the <hi>Church,</hi> or those who pretend themselves intrusted with the Power and Rights of it, in a <hi>Language unknown</hi> unto the community of the people, had not then befallen the Minds of men, no more then it hath yet any countenance given unto it, by the Authority of God, or Reason of mankind. And indeed the Advancement and Defence of this Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is one of those things which sets me at liberty from being influenced by the <hi>Authority</hi> of any sort of men in matters of Religion. For what will not their confidence undertake to vent, and their <hi>Sophistical</hi> Ability give countenance unto, or wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle about, which their interest requires and calls for at their hands; who can openly plead and contend for the truth of such an absurd and irrational Assertion, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all that we know of God and his Will, to all that we understand of our selves or our Duty, with respect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>New Testament</hi> was to be written, the Church was to be diffused
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:200371:117"/> throughout the world, amongst People of all Tongues and Languages under Heaven: Yet there was a necessity that it should be written in <hi>some one certain Language,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the sacred Truth of it might, as in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Records, be safely laid up and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited. It was left, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a good and sacred <hi>depositum</hi> unto the Ministry of the Church to be kept invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, by the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. And it was disposed into Writing in <hi>one certain Language,</hi> wherein the preservation of it in purity, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Ministry of all Ages; not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, but under his care and inspection. From this <hi>one Language</hi> God had ordained, that it should be derived by the care of the Ministry unto the knowledg and use of all Nations and People. And this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by the <hi>Miraculous Gift of Tongues</hi> communicated by the Holy Ghost unto the first designed Publishers of the Gospel. In this case it pleased the Wisdom of the Holy Ghost to make use of the <hi>Greek Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> wherein he writ the whole New Testament Originally. For the report that the Gospel of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were first written in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> is altogether groundless, and I have elsewhere disproved it.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:200371:118"/>
               <p> Now this Language at that season through all sorts of Advantages was diffused throughout the world, especially in those parts of it where God had designed to fix the first and principal station of the Church. For the <hi>Eastern parts</hi> of the world, it was long before carried into them, and its use imposed on them by the <hi>Mecedonian Armes</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> with the establishment of the <hi>Grecian Empire</hi> for sundry Ages among them. And some while before in the <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts</hi> of the world, the same Language was greatly enquired into, and generally received, on the account of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> which was treasured up therein, in the writings of <hi>Poets, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> and <hi>Historians,</hi> which had newly received a peculiar advancement.</p>
               <p>For two things fell out in the Providence of God about that season, which greatly conduced unto the furtherance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The <hi>Jews</hi> were wholly possessed of whatever was <hi>true</hi> in Religion, and which lay in a direct subserviency unto the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it self. This they gloried in, and boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, as a Priviledg which they enjoyed above all the world. The <hi>Grecians</hi> on the other hand, were possessed of skill and Wisdom in all Arts and Sciences, with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:200371:118"/> the products of <hi>Philosophical enquiries,</hi> and elegancy of speech in expressing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of their minds. And this they gloried in and boasted of above all other People in the world. Now both these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being dispossessed of their <hi>Empire, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity,</hi> and <hi>Liberty at home</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> multitudes of them made it their business to disperse themselves in the world, and to seek as it were a <hi>new Empire,</hi> the one to its <hi>Religion,</hi> and the other to its <hi>Language,</hi> Arts and Sciences. Of both sorts with their design, the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers in those days do take notice, and greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. And these Priviledges being boasted of, and rested in, proved equally prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to both Nations, as to the <hi>Reception of the Gospel,</hi> as our Apostle disputes at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 2. But through the wisedom of God disposing and ordering all things unto his own Glory, the design and actings of them both became an effectual means to <hi>facilitate</hi> the Propagation of the Gospel. For the <hi>Jews</hi> having plainted <hi>Synagogues</hi> in most Nations and principal Citys of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> they had both leavened Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people with some knowledg of the true God, which prepared the way of the Gospel; as also they had gathered <hi>fixed</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:200371:119"/>
                  <hi>Assemblies,</hi> which the Preachers of the Gospel constantly took the Advantage of, to enter upon their work, and to begin the declaration of their message. The <hi>Grecians</hi> on the other hand, had so universally diffused the Knowledg of their <hi>Language,</hi> as the use of that one Tongue alone was sufficient to instruct all sorts of people throughout the world in the Knowledg of the Truth. For the <hi>Gift of Tongues</hi> was only to be a <hi>sign unto unbeleivers,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. And not a means of Preaching the Gospel constantly in a Language which he understood not who spake.</p>
               <p>In this Language therefore as the most common, diffusive, and generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the world, did God order that the Books of the <hi>New Testament</hi> should be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. From thence by Translations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, was it to be derived into other Tongues and Languages. For the design of God was still the same, that his Word should be declared unto the Church, in a Language <hi>which</hi> it understood. Hence is that peculiar Distribution of the Nations of the world, into <hi>Jews, Greeks, Barbarians and Scythians;</hi> not accommodated unto the use of those times in <hi>Grecian Writers,</hi> unto whom the <hi>Jews</hi> were no less <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:200371:119"/> then the <hi>Scythians</hi> themselves, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. But as the Scriptures of the Old Testament were peculiarly given unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> so were those of the New unto the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is, those who made use of their Language, from whence it was deduced unto all other Nations, called <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Scythians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It must be acknowledged that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as written in these Languages, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many and great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. (1.) In them peculiarly is it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Writing by divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Book of Writing of the Lord, Isa.</hi> 34. 16. With a singular Priviledg above all Translations. Hence the very words themselves as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in used and placed are <hi>sacred, consecrated by God</hi> unto that holy use. The <hi>sacred sense</hi> indeed of the words and expression is the <hi>Internum formale sacrum,</hi> or that wherein the Holiness of the Scripture doth consist. But the <hi>Writing it self</hi> in the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, in the words chosen and used by the Holy Ghost, is the <hi>externum formale,</hi> of the Holy Scripture, and is <hi>materially sacred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the sense therefore of the Scripture which principally, and for its own sake we
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:200371:120"/> enquire after and into; that divine sense which as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> speaks, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely above our natural reason, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and comprehension. In the <hi>words</hi> we are concerned with respect thereunto, as by the Wisdom of the Holy Ghost they are designed as the written signs thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>words of the Scripture</hi> being given thus immediately from God, every <hi>Apex, Tittle,</hi> or <hi>Iota</hi> in the whole, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, as that which is an effect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom, and therefore filled with sacred Truth according to their place and measure. Hence they are all under the especial care of God, according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. Verily I say unto you, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Till Heaven and Earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the Law.</hi> That our Saviour doth here intend the <hi>writing of the Scriptures</hi> then in use in the Church, and assure the protection of God unto the least <hi>letter, vowel</hi> or <hi>point</hi> of it, I have proved elsewhere. And himself in due time will reprove the profane boldness of them, who without evidence or sufficient proof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that respect and reverence which is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:200371:120"/> due unto the Interest, Care, Providence and Faithfulness of God in this matter, do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert <hi>manifold changes</hi> to have been made in the original writings of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But as I said, divine senses, and singular mysteries may be couched in the use and disposal of a <hi>letter.</hi> And this God himself hath manifested, as in sundry other instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so in the change of the names of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> and <hi>Sarai,</hi> wherein the addition or alteration of one letter carried along with it a mysterious signification for the use of the Church in all Ages. In Translations nothing of that nature can be observed. And hence a due consideration of the very <hi>accents</hi> in the Original of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as <hi>distinctive</hi> or <hi>conjunctive</hi> is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantage in the Investigation of the sense of particular places and sentences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(3dly)</hi> There is in the Originals of the Scripture a peculiar <hi>Emphasis</hi> of words and expressions, and in them an especial <hi>energy</hi> to intimate and insinuate the sense of the Holy Ghost unto the minds of men, which cannot be traduced into other Languages by Translations, so as to obtain the same Power and efficacy. Now this is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely from the nature of the <hi>Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> themselves, especially not of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:200371:121"/>
                  <hi>Greek</hi> whose Principal advantages and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, in <hi>copiousness,</hi> and <hi>elegancy</hi> are little used in the new Testament; but from a secret impression of <hi>divine Wisdom,</hi> and efficacy accompanying the immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the mind of God in them. There is therefore no small advantage hence to be obtained in the Interpretation of the Scripture. For when we have received an impression on our minds of the sense and intention of the Holy Ghost in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place, we shall seek for meet words to express it by, wherein consists the whole work of Scripture exposition so far as I have any acquaintance with it. <hi>Interpretis officium est, non quid ipse velit, sed quid sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat ille quem interpretatur, exponere. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Apol. Adv. Ruffin.</hi> For when the mind is really affected with the discovery of Truth it self, it will be guided and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the declaration of it unto others.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The whole course of speech, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>New Testament</hi> is accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated unto the nature, use and propriety of that Language, as expressed in other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who wrote therein, and had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect understanding of it. From them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the proper use and sense of the words, Phrases, and expressions in the
<pb facs="tcp:200371:121"/> New Testament much to be learned. This no man can make a Judgment of in a due manner, but he that is <hi>skilled</hi> in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as used and delivered by them: not that I think a <hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>New Testament</hi> may be collected out of <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, Hesychius, Phavorinus, Julius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> and other <hi>Glossaries</hi> from whose <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticismes</hi> and <hi>Vocabularys,</hi> some do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance themselves in curious and bold conjectures; nor from the likeness of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in <hi>Classick</hi> Authours; this only I say, that it is of singular advantage in the Interpretation of the Scripture, that a man be well acquainted with the <hi>Original Languages,</hi> and be able to examine the use and signification of words, Phrases and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as they are applied and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in other Authours. And even to the understanding of the <hi>Greek of the New Testament,</hi> it is necessary that a man have an acquaintance with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the Old. For although I do not judge that there are such a number of <hi>Hebraisms</hi> in it, in a supposed discovery whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists no small part of some mens <hi>critical Observations;</hi> so I readily grant that there is such a <hi>Cognation</hi> and <hi>Alliance</hi> in and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the senses of the one and the other,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:200371:122"/> as that a due comparing of their expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doth mutually contribute light and perspicuity unto them.</p>
               <p>By these things great advantage may be obtained unto the right understanding of the sense of the Scripture, or the mind of the Holy Ghost therein. For there is no other sense in it then what is contained in the words, whereof <hi>materially</hi> it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, though really that sense it self be such as our minds cannot receive without the especial divine Assistance before pleaded. And in the Interpretation of the mind of any one, it is necessary that the <hi>words</hi> he speakes or writes be rightly understood. And this we cannot do immediately unless we understand the <hi>Language</hi> wherein he speaks, as also the <hi>Idiotisms</hi> of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with the common use and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its <hi>Phraseologie</hi> and expressions. And if we do not hereby come unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect comprehension of the sense intended, because many other things are required thereunto, yet an hindrance is removed, without which we cannot do so, occasions of manifold mistakes are taken away, and the cabinet is as it were unlocked, wherein the Jewel of Truth lies hid, which with a lawful diligent search may be found. And
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:200371:122"/> what Preplexities, mistakes and errors the Ignorance of these <hi>Original Languages</hi> hath cast many expositors into both of old and of late, especially among those who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously adhere unto <hi>one Translation,</hi> and that none of the best, might be manifested by Instances undeniable and that without number. Such is that of the Gloss on <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Hoereticum hominem de vita;</hi> which adds as its exposition; <hi>tolle.</hi> And those among our selves who are less skilled in this knowledg, are to he advised, that they would be careful not to adventure on any <hi>singular exposition of the Scriptures,</hi> or any <hi>Text</hi> in them, upon the credit of any one or all Translations they can make use of, seeing Persons of greater name and worth then to be mentioned unto their disrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, have miscarried upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. A Reverential Subjection of mind, and diligent attendance unto the <hi>Analogy of Faith</hi> is their best preservative in this matter. And I fear not to add, that a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Knowledg in these Tongues,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aim at, is of little use, unless it be to make men <hi>adventurous</hi> in betraying their own ignorance. But the sense and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Scripture being contained entirely in every <hi>good Translation,</hi> (amongst
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:200371:123"/> which that in use among our selves is <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> though capable of great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) men may by the use of the means before directed unto, and under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Teaching of the Spirit of God in them, usefully and rightly expound the Scripture in general, unto the edification of others, whereof many Instances may be given amongst antient and modern expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Skill and Knowledg</hi> therefore is of great use unto them who are called unto the Interpretation of the Scripture. And the Church of God hath had no small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the endeavours of men <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> herein, who have exercised it in the exposition of the words and <hi>Phraseology</hi> of the Scriptures, as compared with their use in other Authours. But yet, as was before observed, this skill and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it, in the way mentioned, is no <hi>Duty</hi> in it self, nor enjoyned unto any for its own sake, but only hath a <hi>Goodness</hi> in it with respect unto a certain end. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in its own nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> and in its utmost improvement capable of <hi>abuse;</hi> and such in late daies it hath fallen under, unto a great extremity. For the study of the <hi>Original Languages,</hi> and the exercise
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:200371:123"/> of skill in them, in the Intepretation of the Scripture, hath been of great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and that deservedly. Hence multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of learned men have ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that work and study, and the number of <hi>Annotations</hi> and <hi>Comments</hi> on the Scripture consisting principally in <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Observations</hi> as they are called, have been greatly encreased. And they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stangers unto these things, who will not allow that many of them are of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar use. But withal, this skill and faculty where it hath been unaccompanied with that humility, sobriety, reverence of the Authour of the Scripture, and respect unto the <hi>Analogie of Faith,</hi> which ought to bear sway in the minds of all men who undertake to expound the Oracles of God, may be, and hath been greatly abused un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hurt of its owners, and disadvantage of the Church.</p>
               <p>For (1.) by some it hath been turned into the fewel of Pride, and a noysome elation of mind. Yea experience shews that this <hi>kind of Knowledg</hi> where it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed signal, is of all others the most apt to puff up and swell the vain minds of men, unless it be where it is allayed with a singular modesty of nature, or the mind it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:200371:124"/> self be sufficiently corrected and changed by grace. Hence the expressions of Pride and self-conceit which some have broken forth into on an imagination of their skill and faculty in <hi>Criticizing</hi> on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have been ridiculous and impious. The Holy Ghost usually teacheth not such Persons, neither should I expect to learn much from them relating unto the Truth as it is in Jesus. But yet the <hi>stones</hi> they digg may be made use of by a <hi>skilfull</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In many it hath been accompanied with a noxious <hi>prophane curiosity.</hi> Every Tittle and Apex shall give them occasion for <hi>fruitless conjectures,</hi> as vain for the most part as those of the <hi>Cabbalistical Jews.</hi> And this humour hath filled us with <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> and <hi>futilous</hi> observations, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an ostentation of the Learning of their Authours (indeed the utmost end whereunto they are designed) are of no use nor consideration. But this is not all; some men from hence have been promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto a boldness in adventuring to <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Text</hi> it self, or the plain sense of it. For what else is done when men for an ostentation of their skill, will produce quotations out of <hi>learned Authours,</hi> to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:200371:124"/> or expound sayings in the Scripture, wherein there seems to be some kind of compliance in words and sounds, when their senses are adverse and contrary. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a thousand instances which might be given to exemplify this folly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, we need take that one alone of him, who to explain or illustrate that saying of <hi>Hezekiah, Good is the Word of the Lord which thou hast spoken; he said moreover, for there shall be Peace and Truth in my daies, Isa.</hi> 39. 8. Subjoyns, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; So comparing that holy mans submission and satisfaction in the Peace of the Church with Truth, and the <hi>blasphemous imprecation</hi> of an impious wretch for confusion on the World, when once he should be got out of it. And such notable sayings are many of our <hi>late Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> farced withal.</p>
               <p>And the confidence of some hath fallen into greater excesses, and hath swelled over these bounds also. To countenance their conjectures and self pleasing imaginations, from whence they expect no small repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for skill and Learning, they fall in <hi>upon the Text</hi> it self. As indeed we are come into an Age wherein many seem to judge that they can neither sufficiently
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:200371:125"/> value themselves, nor obtain an estimation in the World, without some bold sallys of <hi>curiosity</hi> or <hi>novelty</hi> into the vitals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with reflection of contempt and scorn on all that are otherwise minded, as persons uncapable of comprehending their Attainments. Hence it is that amongst our selves we have scarce any thing left <hi>unattacqued</hi> in the Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and of that in <hi>England</hi> as in former days; neither shall he be with many esteemed a man either of Parts, Learning, or Judgment, who hath not some <hi>new curious Opinion</hi> or <hi>Speculation</hi> differing from what hath been formerly commonly taught and received, although the Universality of these renowned notions among us, are but corrupt Emanations from <hi>Socinianisme</hi> or <hi>Arminianisme</hi> on the one hand, or from <hi>Popery</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But it is men of another sort, and in Truth of another manner of Learning, then the present corrupters of the Doctrines of the Gospel, (who so far as I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive trouble not themselves about the Scripture much one way or another) that we treat about. They are such as in the exercise of the skill and ability under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:200371:125"/> do fall in upon the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, to make way for the advancement of their own conjuctures, whereof <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> are not of the least importance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Duty and necessity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the sacred Text inviolate, and the just and due perswasion that so it hath been preserved. For first, they command the <hi>vowels and Accents</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text out of their way, as things wherein they are not concerned, when the use of them in any one page of the Scripture, is <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably</hi> of more worth and use, then all that they are or ever will be of, in the Church of God. And this is done on slight <hi>conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</hi> And if this suffice not to make way for their designs, then <hi>letters and words</hi> themselves must be corrected, upon an unproveable supposition, that the <hi>Original Text hath been changed or corrupted.</hi> And the boldness of some herein is grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, so that it is as likely means for the Introduction and Promotion of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,</hi> as any engine the Devil hath set on work in these daies wherein he is so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged in that design.</p>
               <p>There are also sundry other waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this great help unto the understanding and Interpretation of the Scripture, may
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:200371:126"/> be and hath been abused; those mentioned may suffice as instances confirming our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. Wherefore as <hi>Substantial</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and skill in the <hi>Originals</hi> is useful and indeed necessary unto him that is called unto the exposition of the Scripture, so in the use and exercise of it sundry things ought to be well considered by them who are furnished therewithal. As (1.) That the thing it self is <hi>no Grace,</hi> nor any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Gift</hi> of the Holy Ghost, but a meer <hi>fruit of diligence,</hi> upon a common furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with natural Abilities. And nothing of this nature is in sacred things to be rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, or much trusted unto. (2.) That the <hi>exercise of this skill</hi> in and about the Scripture is not in it self as such an <hi>especial or immediate Duty.</hi> Were it so, there would be <hi>especial Grace promised</hi> to fill it up and quicken it. For all <hi>Gospel Duties</hi> are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by Grace in their due performance: that is, those who do so perform them have especial assistance in their so doing. But it is reduced unto the general head of Duty with respect unto the end aimed at. Wherefore (3.) The <hi>Blessing of God</hi> on our endeavours, succeeding and prospering of them, as in other natural and civil occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, is all that we expect herein
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:200371:126"/> from the Holy Spirit. And (4.) Sundry other things are required of us, if we hope for this Blessing on just Grounds. It may be some ignorant persons are so fond as to imagin that if they could understand the <hi>Original Languages,</hi> they must of necessity understand the sense of the Scripture. And there is nothing more frequent then for some, who either truely or falsely pretend a skill in them, to bear themselves high against those who perhaps are really more acquainted with the mind of the Holy Ghost in the word then themselves, as though <hi>all things were plain and obvious unto them,</hi> others knowing nothing but by them, or such as they are. But this is but one means of many that is useful to this purpose, and that such, as if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is of little or no use at all. It is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer, Humility, Lowliness of mind, Godly Fear and Reverence of the word, and subjection of conscience unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of every Tittle of it, a constant attendance unto the <hi>Analogie</hi> of Faith, with due dependance on the Spirit of God for supplies of Light and Grace, which must make this or any other means of the same nature effectual.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:200371:127"/>
               <p> An Acquaintance with the <hi>History and Geography of the World,</hi> and with <hi>Chronology,</hi> I reckon also among <hi>Disciplinarian</hi> Aids in the Interpretation of the Scripture. For as time is divided into what is past, and what is to come, so there are sundry things in the Scripture which in all seasons relate thereunto. For (first) God hath therein given us an account of the course and order of all things, (which the <hi>Jews</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) from the foundation of the World. And this he did for Sundry important Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as incident with the general end of the Scripture. For hereby hath he secured the Testimony that he hath given to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Power and Providence by the <hi>creation</hi> and Rule of all things. The evidences in them given thereunto, are those which are principally attacqued by <hi>Atheists.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do sufficiently manifest and evince their own Testimony unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reason of mankind, yet sundry things relating unto them are so involved in darkness, and inextricable circumstances, as if all their concernments had not been plainly declared in the Scripture, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of men had been at a great loss about them; and so were they alwaies who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Light and advantage hereof. But
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:200371:127"/> here as he hath plainly declared the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal Emanation</hi> of all things from his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, so hath he testified unto his constant Rule over all in all Times, Places, Ages and Seasons, by instances incontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Therein hath he treasured up all sorts of examples, with such impressions of his Goodness, Patience, Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Holiness and Righteousness upon them, as proclaim his Almighty and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Government of the whole universe. And in the whole he hath delivered unto us such a <hi>tract and series of the Ages of the World,</hi> from its beginning, as <hi>Atheisme</hi> hath no tollerable pretence, from Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Testimony, or the evidence of things themselves, to break in upon. Whatever is objected against the beginning of all things, and the course of their continuance in the World delivered unto us in the Scripture, which is secured not only by the Authority of divine Revelation, but also by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal evidence of all circumstances, is fond and ridiculous. I speak of the account given us in general, sufficient unto its own ends, and not of any mens <hi>Deductions</hi> and applications of it unto minute portions of time, which probably it was not designed unto. It is sufficient unto its end, that its
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:200371:128"/> account in general, which confounds all <hi>Atheistical</hi> presumptions, is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached. And although the Authority of the Scripture is not to be pleaded immediately against <hi>Atheists,</hi> yet the matter and Reason of it is, which from its own evidence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all contrary pretensions contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> God hath hereby given an account of the <hi>Biginning, Progress, Trials, Faith, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and whole proceeding of the Church in the pursuit of the first Promise, unto the actual exhibition of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Hereunto were all things in a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency for <hi>four thousand years.</hi> It is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prospect we have therein, to see the call and foundation of the Church in the first Promise given unto our common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; what additions of light and Knowledg he granted unto it successively by new Revelations and Promises; how he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually adorned it with Gifts, Priviledges and Ordinances; what waies and means he used to preserve it in Faith, Purity and Obedience; how he chastened, tried, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and delivered it; how he dealt with the nations of the World with respect unto it, raising them up for its affliction, and destroying them for their cruelty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:200371:128"/> of it; whatwere the waies of wicked and sinful men amongst them, or in it, and what the Graces and fruits of his Saints, how by his Power he retrieved it out of various calamities, and preserved it against all opposition unto its appointed season; all which with innumerable other effects of divine Wisdom and Grace, are blessedly represented unto us therein.</p>
               <p>Now besides that spiritual wisdom and insight into the great design of God in Christ, which is required unto a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in these things, as they were <hi>Types</hi> of better things to come, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gospel Mysteries; there is a skill and understanding in the Records and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of time, the <hi>Geographical</hi> respect of one nation unto another, the <hi>Periods</hi> and Revolutions of seasons and Ages required, to apprehend them aright in their first lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instance and intention. And besides what is thus <hi>Historically</hi> related in the Scripture, there are <hi>Prophesies</hi> also of things to come in the Church, and amongst the nations of the World, which are great evidences of its own Divinity, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting arguments of our Faith. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some good apprehension of the <hi>distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of times, seasons</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> no man can rightly judge of their accomplishment.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:200371:129"/>
               <p> Secondly, there are, in particular, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies in the Old Testament which reach unto the times of the Gospel, upon the Truth whereof the whole Scripture doth depend. Such are those concerning the <hi>calling of the Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Rejection</hi> and Recovery of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the erection of the glorious Kingdom of Christ in the World, with the oppositions that should be made unto it. And to these many are added in the new Testament it self, as <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 25. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 1, 2, 3. Chap. 4. 3. But especially in the whole Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> wherein the state of the Church and of the World are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told unto the consummation of all things. And how can any man arrive unto a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acquaintance with the <hi>accomplishment of these Prophesies</hi> as to what is already past, or have a distinct grounded expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulfilling of what remains fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, without a prospect into the state of things in the world, the Revolutions of times past with what fell out in them, which are the things spoken of? Those who treat of them without it, do but feign <hi>Chimera</hi>'s to themselves, as men in the dark are apt to do, or corrupt the word of God, by turning it into senseless and fulsome <hi>Allegories.</hi> And those, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:200371:129"/> side, by whom these things are wholly <hi>neglected,</hi> do despise the wisdom and care of God towards the Church, and disregard a blessed means of our Faith and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Some things of this nature, especially such as relate unto <hi>Chronological computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> I acknowledg are attended with great and apparently inextricable difficulties. But the skill and Knowledg mentioned will guide humble and modest enquirers into so sufficient a satisfaction in general, and as unto all things which are really useful, that they shall have no Temptation to question the verity of what in particular they cannot assoyle. And it is an <hi>intolerable Pride and Folly</hi> where we are guided and satisfied infallibly in a thousand things, which we know no otherwise, to question the Authority of the whole, because we cannot comprehend one or two particulars which perhaps were never intended to be reduced unto our measure. Besides, as the Investigation of these things is attended with difficulties, so the Ignorance of them or mistakes about them, whilst the minds of men are free from pertinacy and a Spirit of contention, are of no great <hi>disadvantage.</hi> For they have very little influence on our Faith and Obedience, any otherwise then
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:200371:130"/> that we call not into question what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. And it is most probable that the Scripture never intended to give us such <hi>minute Chronological Determinations,</hi> as some would deduce their computations unto, and that because not necessary. Hence we see that some who have laboured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in unto a <hi>prodigy of Industry</hi> and Learning, although they have made some useful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, yet have never been able to give such evidence unto their <hi>computations,</hi> as that others would acquiesce in them; but by all their endeavours have administred occasion of <hi>new strife</hi> and contention, about things it may be of no great importance to be known or determined. And in general men have run into two extreams in these things; For some pretend to frame an <hi>exact computation</hi> and <hi>consent of times</hi> from the Scripture alone, without any regard unto the Records, Monuments, Histories and <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures</hi> of times in the world. Wherever these appear in opposition or contradiction unto the <hi>chain</hi> and <hi>links</hi> of time which they have framed to themselves (as they suppose from the Scripture) they reject them as matters of no consideration. And it were well if they could do this unto sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. But how evidently they have failed herein, as for instance in the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:200371:130"/> of <hi>Daniels weeks</hi> wherein they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but 490 years from the <hi>first of Cvrus unto the Death of our Saviour,</hi> contrary to the common consent of mankind about things that fell out, and their continuance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those seasons, taking up 562 years, is manifest unto all. The Scripture indeed is to be made the only <hi>sacred stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> and measure of things in its proper sense and understanding; nor is any thing to be esteemed of, which riseth up in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction thereunto. But as a due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>forraign Testimonies</hi> and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth oft times give great light unto what is more generally or obscurely expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Scripture; so where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in these things, with such allowances as it every where declares it self to admit of, may be interpreted in a fair compliance with <hi>uncontrouled forraign Testimonies,</hi> that Interpretation is to be embraced. The Question is not therefore, whether we shall regulate the computation of times by the Scripture, or Histories and marks of time in the World; but whether, when the sense of the Scripture is <hi>obscure</hi> in those things, and its determination only general, so as to be equally capable of various senses, that (all other things being alike) is not to be preferred which agrees with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:200371:131"/>
                  <hi>Monuments</hi> of times in the Nations of the World. For instance, the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> acquaints <hi>Daniel</hi> that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> unto <hi>Messiah the Prince</hi> and his cutting off, should be <hi>Seventy weeks,</hi> (to speak only of the whole number in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) that is, 490 <hi>yeares;</hi> now there were sundry Commandments given, or decrees made by the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to this purpose; of these two were the most famous, the one granted by <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the first <hi>year of his Empire, Ezra.</hi> 1. 1. The other by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the 7th year of his <hi>Reign, Ezra.</hi> 7. 12, 13, 14. Between the first of these and the death of Christ there must be allowed 562 years, unless you will offer violence unto all Monuments, Records, and circumstances of times in the World. It is therefore safer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the general words of the Angel of the <hi>latter Decree</hi> or Commandment, whose circumstances also make it more probable to be intended, wherein the spaces of time mentioned falls in exactly with other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Histories</hi> and Records. Neither would I disallow another computation, which contending for the first <hi>decree of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to be the beginning of the time men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and allowing the whole space from
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:200371:131"/> thence to be really 562 years, affirms that the Scripture excludes the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the years <hi>supernumerary</hi> to the 490, because of the Interruptions which at several seasons were put upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the accomplishment of the things foretold for so many years, which some suppose to be signified by the distribution of the whole number of 70 <hi>weeks,</hi> into <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, sixty two and one,</hi> each of which fract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions hath its proper work belonging unto it. For this computation offers no <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> either to sacred, or unquestionable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority.</p>
               <p>But on the other extream, some there are who observing the difficulties in these accounts, as expressed in the Scripture from the beginning; having framed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>series of things</hi> to themselves, openly divers from that exhibited therein, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together from other Authours, some things giving countenance unto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, do prophanely make bold to break in upon the <hi>Original Text,</hi> accusing it of <hi>imperfection</hi> or <hi>corruption,</hi> which they will rectify by their <hi>fine inventions,</hi> and the aid of a <hi>Translation,</hi> known to be mistaken in a <hi>thousand places,</hi> and in some justly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of wilful depravations. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous confidence is nothing but an
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:200371:132"/> emanation from that <hi>flood of Atheism</hi> which is breaking in on the world in these decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Ages</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>The third Aid or Assistance of this kind is a skill in the <hi>waies and methods of reasoning,</hi> which are supposed to be common unto the Scriptures with other writings. And this, as it is an <hi>Art,</hi> or an <hi>Artificial faculty,</hi> like those other means before mentioned, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a right improvement, or of being abused. An <hi>Ability to judge of the sense of Propositions,</hi> how one thing depends on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how it is deduced from it, follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, or is proved by it, what is the design of him that writes or speaks in any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or Reasonings, how it is proposed, confirmed, illustrated, is necessary unto any rational consideration to be exercised about whatever is so proposed unto us. And when the minds of men are confirmed in a good <hi>habit of Judgment by the Rules of the Art of Reasoning,</hi> about the ordinary waies and Methods of it, it is of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the <hi>Investigation of the sense</hi> of any writer even of the Scripture it self. And those ordinarily who shall undertake the Interpretation of any <hi>series of Scripture</hi> discourse, without some ability in this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will find themselves oftentimes <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi> and at a loss, where by vertue of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:200371:132"/> it they might be at liberty and free. And many of the <hi>Rules</hi> which are commonly given about the Interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as namely, that the <hi>Scope</hi> of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> in the place is duely to be considered, as also things <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>consequent</hi> to the place and words to be interpreted, and the like, are but directions for the due use of this <hi>Skill</hi> or faculty.</p>
               <p>But this also must be admitted with its limitations. For whatever perfection there seems to be in our Art of reasoning, it is to be subjected to the Wisdom of the Holy Ghost in the Scripture. His way of Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is alwaies his own, sometimes <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> so as not to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto the common Rules of our Arts and Sciences, without a derogation from its <hi>instructive, convictive,</hi> and <hi>perswasive</hi> efficacy. For us to frame unto our selves <hi>Rules of Ratiocination,</hi> or to have our minds embondaged unto those of other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and observation, if we think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on absolutely to reduce all the Reasonings in the Scripture unto them, we may fall into a presumptuous mistake. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of all effects of infinite Wisdom there must be an allowance for the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of our comprehension, when humble subjection of conscience, and the captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:200371:133"/> of our understandings to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, is the best means of learning what is proposed unto us. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more contemptible then the <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy</hi> of such Persons, who think by the shallow measures and short lines of their own weak, dark, imperfect Reasonings, to fathom the depths of Scripture senses.</p>
               <p>Again; What sense soever any man supposeth or judgeth this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place of Scripture to yield and give out to the best of his rational intelligence, is immediately to give place unto the <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Faith,</hi> that is the Scriptures own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of its sense in other places, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother purpose or contrary thereunto. The want of attending unto mens duty herein, with a <hi>mixture of Pride and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy,</hi> is the occasion of most errors and noxious Opinions in the World. For when some have taken up a <hi>private Interpretation</hi> of any place of Scripture, if before they have throughly imbibed and vented it, they do not submit their conceptions, although they seem to be greatly satisfied in it and full of it, unto the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the declaration of its own mind in other places, there is but small hope of their recovery. And this is that Pride which is the sourse and Original of <hi>Heresy;</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:200371:133"/> namely, when men will prefer their <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wise</hi> and rational conceptions of the sense of <hi>particular places,</hi> before the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> of Faith.</p>
               <p>Moreover there is a pernitious mistake that some are fallen into about these things. They suppose that taking in the help of <hi>skill in the Original Languages</hi> for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the words and their use, whether proper or figurative, that there is nothing more necessary to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interpretation of the Scripture, but only <hi>the sedulous and diligent use of our own Reason,</hi> in the ordinary way, and according to the common Rules of the <hi>Art of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination.</hi> For what, say they, can be more required, or what can men more make use of? By these means alone do we come to understand the meaning of any other <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and therefore also of the Scripture. Neither can we, nor doth God require, that we should receive or believe any thing but according to our own Reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings. But these things, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they are, some of them, partly true, yet as they are used unto the end mentioned, they are pernitiously false. For (1.) It great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unbecometh any Christian once to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that there is need <hi>of no other assistance,</hi> nor the use of any other means for the In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:200371:134"/> of the Oracles of God, or to come unto the understanding of the <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Wisdom of God in the mystery of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> then is to the understanding or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Writings of men, which are the product of a finite, limited and weak ability. Were it not for some secret Perswasion that the Scripture indeed is not what it pretends to be, <hi>the Word of the Living God,</hi> or that it doth not indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the <hi>highest effect of his Wisdom,</hi> and deepest counsel of his will, it could not be that men should give way to such foolish imaginations. The principal matter of the Scripture is <hi>Mysterious;</hi> and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of it are laid up therein by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that in a way <hi>inimitable</hi> by the skill or Wisdom of men. When we speak of, and express the same things according unto our measure of comprehension, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from its agreement with the Scripture, what we say is <hi>materially divine,</hi> yet our words are not so, nor is there the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the things themselves, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Scripture have, which are <hi>formally</hi> divine. And can we our selves trace these paths of Wisdom without his especial Guidance and Assistance? It is highly <hi>Atheistical</hi> once to fancy it. (2) We treat of such an Interpretation of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:200371:134"/> Scripture as is <hi>real,</hi> and is accompanied with an understanding of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and expressed; and not meerly of the <hi>notional sense of Propositions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</hi> For we speak of such an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Scripture as is a sanctified means of our <hi>Illumination;</hi> nor any other doth either the Scripture require, or God regard. That to give in this unto us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the use and advantage of all outward helps and means, is the peculiar work of the Spirit of God, hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demonstrated. It is true, we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing, reject nothing as to what is true or false, nor conceive the sense of any thing but by our own <hi>Reasons</hi> and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings. But the Enquiry herein is, what <hi>supernatural Aid and Assistance</hi> our minds and natural Reasons stand in need of, to enable them to receive and understand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right things spiritual and supernatural. And if it be true, that no more is required unto the due Understanding and Interpretation of the Scriptures, but the exercise of our <hi>own Reasons,</hi> in and by the helps mentioned, namely, <hi>skill in the Original Languages, the Arts of Ratiocination,</hi> and the like, which are exposed unto all in common, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure of their natural Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Diligence, then is the sense of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:200371:135"/> Scripture, that is, the Mind of God and Christ therein, <hi>equally discernable,</hi> or to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by all sorts of men, good and bad, holy and prophane, believers and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, those who obey the Word, and those who despise it; which is contrary to all the Promises of God, and innumerable other Testimonies of Scripture.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Helps Ecclesiastical in the Interpretation of the Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THirdly, There are means and helps for the Interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I call <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> Those I intend which we are supplied withall by the <hi>Ministry of the Church,</hi> in all Ages. And they may be referred unto three heads, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which their usefulness to this purpose is pleaded. As (1.) <hi>Catholick or Ʋniversal Tradition.</hi> (2.) <hi>Consent of the Fathers.</hi> (3.) <hi>The endeavours of any persons holy and learned,</hi> who have gone before us in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigation of the Truth, and exprest their minds in writing, for the Edification of others, whether of <hi>old</hi> or of <hi>late.</hi> These things belong unto the Ministry of the Church, and so far as they do so are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:200371:135"/> Ordinances for the communication of the Mind of God unto us,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is pleaded by some that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be interpreted according to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Tradition</hi> and no otherwise. And I do acknowledg that we should be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressibly obliged to them who would give us an Interpretation of the <hi>whole Scripture,</hi> or of any <hi>Book in the Scripture,</hi> or of any <hi>one passage</hi> in the Scripture relating unto things of meer supernatural Revelation, according unto that <hi>Rule,</hi> or by the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Direction of it. But I fear no such Tradition can be evidenced, unless it be of things manifest in the light of nature, whose universal preservation is an effect of the unavoidable Reason of mankind, and not of any <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Tradition. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Scripture it self is testified unto unanimously and uninterruptedly by all Christians to be the Word of God; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are all divine Truths conveyed down from their Original and delivered unto us. But a <hi>Collateral Tradition</hi> of any one Truth or Doctrin besides, from Christ &amp; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les cannnot be proved. And if it could be so, it would be no means of the Interpretation of the Scripture, but only <hi>objectively,</hi> as one place of Scripture interprets another; that is, it would belong unto the <hi>Analogie of</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:200371:136"/>
                  <hi>Faith,</hi> contrary to which, or in opposition whereunto, no place ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. To pretend this therefore to be the Rule of the Interpretation of Scripture <hi>actively,</hi> as though thereby we could cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly learn the meaning of it in <hi>part or in whole,</hi> is fond. Nor, whatever some do boast of, can any man living prove his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of any one place, to be dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by, or to be suitable unto <hi>Ʋniversal Tradition,</hi> any otherwise but as he can prove it to be agreeable to the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self; unless we shall acknowledg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof, that what is the mind and sense of some men who call themselves the Church at present, was the Mind of Christ and his Apostles, and of all true Believers since, and that infallibly it is so. But this pretence hath been abundantly and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently disproved, though nothing seems to be so, to the minds of men fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all evidences of Truth by invincible prejudices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>joynt consent of the Fathers</hi> or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Doctors of the Church is also preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a Rule of Scripture Interpretation. But those who make this <hi>Plea</hi> are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently influenced by their supposed intrest so to do. No man of ingenuity, who hath ever read or considered them or any of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:200371:136"/> them with attention and judgment can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide by this pretence. For it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should be an <hi>Authentick Rule</hi> unto others, who so disagree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as they will be found to do, not it may be so much in <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> as in their <hi>exposition of Scripture,</hi> which is the matter under consideration. About the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they express themselves diversly, in the latter they <hi>really differ,</hi> and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. Those who seem most earnestly to press this <hi>Dogme</hi> upon us, are those of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> And yet it is hard to find one learned man among them, who hath undertaken to expound or write <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> on the Scripture, but on all occasions he gives us the different senses, expositions and Interpretations of the Fathers, of the same places and Texts; and that where any difficulty occurs in a manner perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But the pretence of the <hi>Authoratative Determination</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in points of Religion, hath been so disproved, and the vanity of it so fully discovered, as that it is altogether needless farther to insist upon it. And those who would seem to have found out a middle way, between their <hi>determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authority</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>efficacy</hi> of their <hi>Reasons,</hi> with a due venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Piety and Ability, which all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:200371:137"/> sober men allow, on the other, do but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle and speak words, whose sense neither themselves nor any other do understand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We say therefore that the sole use of <hi>Ecclesiastical means</hi> in the Interpretation of the Scripture, is in the due consideration and improvement of that <hi>Light, Knowledg, Ʋnderstanding</hi> in, and those <hi>Gifts</hi> for the declaration of the Mind of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he hath granted unto, and furnished them withal, who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the <hi>Ministry</hi> and work of the Gospel. For as God in an especial manner in all Ages took care that the Doctrine of the Gospel should be preached <hi>viva voce,</hi> to the present edification of the body of the Church; so likewise almost from the beginning of its propagation in the World, presently after the decease of the Apostles, and that whole divinely inspired society of Preachers and Writers, he stirred up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled sundry persons to declare by <hi>writing</hi> what their apprehensions were, and what <hi>understanding</hi> God had given them in and about the sense of the Scripture. Of those who designedly wrote Comments and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions on any part of the Scripture <hi>Origen</hi> was the first, whose fooleries and mistakes occasioned by the prepossession of his mind with <hi>Platonical Philosophy,</hi> confidence of his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:200371:137"/> own great Abilities, (which indeed were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and admirable) with the curiosity of a speculative mind, discouraged not others from endeavouring with more sobriety and better success to write entire Expositions on some parts of the Scripture; such among the Greeks were <hi>Chrisostom, Theodoret, Aretine, Oecomenius, Theophylact;</hi> and among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines <hi>Hierom, Ambrose, Austin,</hi> and others. These have been followed, used, improved, by others innumerable in succeeding Ages. Especially since the Reformation hath the work been carried on with general success, and to the great advantage of the Church. Yet hath it not proceeded so far, but that the best, most useful and profitable labour in the Lords Vineyard, which any holy and learned man can ingage himself in, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the contribution of farther Light in the opening &amp; exposition of Scripture, or any part thereof. Now all these are singular helps and advantages unto the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, of the same kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as to that single End of Light and knowledge, which Preaching of the Word is, used with sobriety, judgment, and a due examination of all by the Text it self. For the <hi>Exposition of the Fathers,</hi> as it is a ridiculous Imagination, and that which would oblige us to the belief of contradictions, and open
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:200371:138"/> mistakes, for any man to <hi>authenticate</hi> them so far as to bind us up unto an assent unto their conceptions and dictates because they are theirs; so they will not be despised by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but such as have not been conversant in them. And it is easie to discern from them all, by the diversity of their gifts, waies and designs, in the Exposition of Scripture, that the holy Spirit <hi>divided unto them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi> which as it should make us reverence his presence with them, and assistance of them, so it calls for the freedom of our own Judgments to be exercised about their conceptions. And for those of <hi>latter</hi> daies, though the names of the principal and most eminent of them, as <hi>Bucer, Calvin, Martyr, Beza,</hi> are now contemned and despised by many, mostly by those who never once seriously attempted the exposition of any one Chapter in the whole Scripture; yet those who firmely design to grow in the Knowledg of God, and of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, both do, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies will bless God for the assistance he gave them in their great and holy works, and in the benefit which they receive by their labours. These are the outward means and advantages which are requisite and to be used, as any ones calling, opportunity, Ability, and work, do require, as helps to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:200371:138"/> attain a right understanding of the mind of God in the Scripture. Now concerning them all I shall only say, that the Spirit of God makes them useful and prosperous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counsel of his own Will. Some are prone in the use of them, to lean unto their own understandings, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to wander in and after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their own minds, corrupting the Word of God, and endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his right waies thereby. Others he leaves in the <hi>shell of the Text</hi> to exercise their skill about words, Phrases, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, without leading of them into the Spiritual sense of the word, which is its life and Power. In some he blesseth them to the full and proper end, but not unless they are in a compliance with the spiritual means and duties before insisted on.</p>
               <p>From what hath been discoursed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of the Spirit of God in reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Believers the mind of God in the Scriptures, or the sense of that <hi>Revelation</hi> made of it therein, two things will seem to follow. First, that those who have not that <hi>assistance</hi> granted to them, or that work of his wrought in them, cannot understand or apprehend the Truth or Doctrin of Faith and Obedience therein revealed. For if that work of the Spirit be necessary thereunto, which they are not made partakers of, how
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:200371:139"/> can they come to any knowledge or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing therein? Secondly, that those who are so influenced and guided, <hi>must understand the whole Scripture aright,</hi> and be freed from all mistakes in their conceptions about the mind of God; both which are contrary to the experience of all men in all Ages; seeing many persons visibly destitute of any saving work of the Holy Ghost upon their minds, as is evident in that no renovation of them, or reformation of life doth ensue thereon, have yet <hi>attained a great acquaintance with the Truth</hi> as it is revealed in the Word; and many who are <hi>truly enlightened</hi> and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him, do yet fall into sundry <hi>errors</hi> and mistakes, which the differences and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions among themselves do openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim. And the Scripture it self supposeth that there may be <hi>diversity of Judgments</hi> about spiritual things, among those who are really sanctified and Believers.</p>
               <p>A brief Answer unto both these Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will lead this discourse unto its close. I say therefore to the first; (1.) That there are in the declaration of the mind of God in the Scriptures sundry things that are <hi>common unto other writings,</hi> both as to the matter of them, and the manner of their delivery. Such are the <hi>stories</hi> of times past therein recorded, the <hi>computation of lives,</hi> the use of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:200371:139"/> words, <hi>phrases of speech, figurative</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, artificial</hi> connexions of discourse, <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sorts of Arguments,</hi> and the like; all which persons may come to the understanding of, and be able to make a right judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, without any especial assistance of the holy Spirit, the things about which they are conversant being the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the reasonable faculties of the mind, provided there be a common blessing on their endeavours and exercise. (2.) The <hi>main Doctrines</hi> of Truth declared in the Scripture are proposed in such distinct, <hi>plain Enuntiations,</hi> in propositions accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the understandings of rational men, that persons who in the use of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical helps,</hi> attend unto the study of them without prejudices, or prepossession with false notions and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with freedom from the bias of carnal or secular interests and advantages, and the leaven of Tradition, may learn, know and understand the sense, meaning and truth of the Doctrines so proposed and declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, without any especial work of <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Illumination</hi> on their minds. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of Truth in the Scripture, I mean those which are necessary unto the great ends of the Scripture, are so plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in themselves, that it is the fault and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200371:140"/> sin of all men endued with rational abilities, if they perceive them not, and assent not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them upon the evidence of their truth, or of the mind of God in those places of Scripture wherein they are declared; which is the substance of what we plead concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>perspicuity of the Scripture</hi> against the <hi>Papists.</hi> (3.) Considering the <hi>natural va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the mind of man, its proneness to error and false imaginations, the weakness of Judgement wherewith it is in all things accompanied, whatever it attains in the knowledge of Truth is to be ascribed unto the guidance of the Spirit of God, although not working in it or upon it by a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Saving Light and Grace. For (4) The knowledge of Truth thus to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is not that <hi>Illumination</hi> which we are enquiring after, nor doth it produce those effects of renewing the mind, and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into the Image of the things known, with the fruits of holy obedience, which are inseparable from saving Illumination.</p>
               <p>In answer unto the second pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of what we have discoursed, I say (1.) That the Promise of the Spirit, and the communication of him accordingly, to <hi>teach, instruct,</hi> guide and lead us into Truth, is suited unto that <hi>great end</hi> for which God hath made the Revelation of himself in his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:200371:140"/> Word; namely, that we might live unto him here according to his will, and be brought unto the enjoyment of him hereafter unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. (2.) That unto this end it is not necessary that we should understand the <hi>direct sense and meaning of any single Text,</hi> place or passage in the Scripture, nor yet that we should obtain the knowledge of every thing revealed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It sufficeth in answer to the Promise and design of the work of the Holy Ghost, that the <hi>knowledge of all Truth</hi> necessary to be known unto that end, be communicated unto us; and that we have so far a right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the sense of the Scripture, as to learn that Truth by the use of the means appointed unto that end. (3.) We are not hereby <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely secured</hi> from particular errors and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, no more then we are from all actual sins, by the work of the Spirit on our wills; that of both kinds, whilst we live in this world, being only in a tendency towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. There is no faculty of our souls that is absolutely and perfectly renewed in this life. But as the <hi>Wills</hi> of Believers are so far renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and changed by Grace as to preserve them from <hi>such sins,</hi> as are inconsistent with an holy life according to the Tenor of the Covenant, which yet leaves a possibility of many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and actual sins; so their <hi>minds</hi> are so far renewed as to know and assent to all Truths
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:200371:141"/>
                  <hi>necessary to our life of Obedience,</hi> and a right understanding of the Scripture wherein they are revealed, which yet may be consistent with many mistakes, errors, and false apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto our great damage and disadvantage. But withall this must be added, that such are the Teachings of the Spirit of God, as to all Divine Truths whatever, both in the <hi>Objective Revelation</hi> of them in the Word, and in the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> he gives us by his Light and Grace to perceive and understand the mind and whole counsel of God in that Revelation, that it is not without our own <hi>guilt,</hi> as well as from our own <hi>weakness,</hi> that we fall into errors and misapprehensions about any Scripture Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals that concern our duty to God. And if all that believe, would freely forgo all prejudices or preconceived opinions, and cast off all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions from worldly considerations and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advantages, giving themselves up hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and entirely to the Teachings of God in the waies of his own appointment, some whereof have been before insisted on, we might all come <hi>in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, Ephes.</hi> 4. 13. And these things may suffice to illustrate the work of the Holy Ghost in our <hi>Illumination</hi> with respect unto the external objective causes thereof, or the holy Scripture it self.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:200371:141"/>
               <p> There is yet another work of the Holy Ghost with respect unto the Scripture, which although it fall not directly under the present consideration of the <hi>waies and means of saving Illumination,</hi> yet the whole of what we have discoursed is so resolved into it in the order of an external cause; as that it may justly claim a remembrance in this place; And this is, his <hi>watchful care over the written Word,</hi> in preserving it from destruction and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the first writing of it unto this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. That it hath been under the especial care of God, not only the event of its entire preservation, considering the opposition it hath been exposed unto, but also the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Saviour, as to the <hi>Books of the Old Testament,</hi> then which those of the New are certainly of no less esteem or use, do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evince, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Till Heaven and Earth pass, one jot or tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law.</hi> That by the <hi>Law</hi> the whole writings of the Old Testament are intended, the context doth declare. And what he affirms that it shall not by any means pass away, that is, be abolished or corrupted, that he taketh on himself to preserve and secure. Two things the Scripture in it self is subject unto; (1.) <hi>Destruction</hi> or <hi>Abolition,</hi> as unto the whole or any necessary part thereof. (2.) <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Writing</hi> by changes, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:200371:142"/> and falsifications of the Copies of it. And by both of these it hath been attempted, and that both before and since the time of the promulgation of the Gospel; the stories whereof are known. And yet is it come safe off from all, not only without <hi>ruine,</hi> but without <hi>wound</hi> or <hi>blemish.</hi> For any one to suppose that this hath been done by chance, or by the care of men alone, without the especial watchful Providence, and powerful Actings of the Spirit of God, in the pursuit of the Promise of Christ that it should not fail, which expressed a care that God had taken on himself to make good from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, is not only to neglect the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the nature of all humane affairs, with the Revolutions that they are subject unto, and the deceit and violence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Scriptures have been attacqued, with the insufficiency of the Powers and Diligence employed for their preservation; but also to countenance <hi>Atheistical Notions,</hi> that God hath no especial regard to his Word and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the world. Indeed for a man to think and profess that the Scripture is the Word of God, given unto men for the ends which it self declares, and of that use which it must be of in being so, and not believe that God hath alwaies taken, and doth take especial care of its preservation, and that in its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:200371:142"/> and integrity, beyond the ordinary waies of his Providence in the Rule of all other things, is to be sottish and foolish, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoughts of God, his Goodness, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, infinitely unworthy of him and them. There have of late been some Opinions concerning the <hi>integrity and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Scriptures, invented and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I conceive take off from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that relation which the Scripture hath, in its integrity and purity, unto the care and glory of God. Hence it is by some maintained that some Books written by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration, and given out unto the Church as part of its <hi>Canon</hi> or Rule of Faith and Obedience, are utterly lost and perished. That the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament before the <hi>Captivity,</hi> were written though in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> (which they say was not originally the Language of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> derived from <hi>Heber,</hi> but of the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Cham</hi> in <hi>Canaan)</hi> yet not in the <hi>Letters</hi> or <hi>Characters</hi> which are now in use, but in those which a few wicked Idolaters called <hi>Samaritanes</hi> did use and possess, being left unto them by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and new Characters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by him, or borrowed from the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> for the use of the Church. That the <hi>Vowels and Accents,</hi> whereby alone the true reading and sense of it is preserved, are a late
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:200371:143"/> invention of some <hi>Masorethical Rabbins;</hi> and that the <hi>Original Text</hi> is in many places cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, so as that it may and ought to be corrected by Translations, especially that of the LXX, with sundry other such imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they countenance with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain conjectures, and fabulous stories. And I cannot but wonder how some seem to take <hi>Shelter unto their Opinions,</hi> especially that of preferring the <hi>Translation of the LXX</hi> unto the Original <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> or as they fondly speak, the present Copy of it, in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whose <hi>publickly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and excellent Translation,</hi> takes no more notice, nor hath any more regard unto that Translation, when it differs from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as it doth in a thousand places, then if it had never been in the world. And as no Translations are in common use in the whole world, but what were immediately tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the <hi>Hebrew Original,</hi> excepting only some <hi>parts of the Vulgar Latine;</hi> so I verily believe, that those very Christians who contend for a <hi>preference</hi> to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of the LXX, now they have got their Ends; or at least attempted them in procuring a reputation of Learning, Skill and Cunning by their <hi>writings about it,</hi> would not dare to advise a Translation out of that to be made and composed for the use of <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:200371:143"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> which they adhere unto, be it what it will; to the rejection and exclusion of that taken out of the Original. And to have two recommended unto common use, so discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant as they would be found to be, would certainly be of more disadvantage to the Church, then by all their Endeavours other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they can compensate. Yea I am apt to think, that they will not be very urgent for an alteration to be made in the <hi>Churches Translation</hi> in those particular instances wherein they hope they have won them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves much reputation, in proving the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of the Hebrew,</hi> and manifesting how it may be rectified by the <hi>Translation</hi> of the LXX. For whatever thoughts may be in their minds concerning their learned Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, I doubt not but they have more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God and his Word, then to break in upon it with such a kind of violence, on any pretence whatsoever. As therefore the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and purity of the Scripture in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Languages</hi> may be proved and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against all opposition, with whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs thereunto, so we must ascribe their preservation to the watchful care, and power ful operation of the Spirit of God absolutely securing them throughout all Generations.</p>
